# Overview

The data module streamlines data management by allowing you to store your datasets in the application instead of uploading them every time you test prompts in the playground or upload files for fine-tuning the model. Additionally, the module provides flexibility to store files of different file formats such as CSV, JSON, and JSONL without any additional formatting requirements, ultimately enhancing convenience for you while working with large datasets within the product.
