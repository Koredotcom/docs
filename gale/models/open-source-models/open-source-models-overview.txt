# Open-Source Models

Open-source models refer to the models for which the source code is openly available. You can deploy them in GALE and use them either, throughout GALE, or externally via a generated API endpoint. Kore.ai provides a curated list of 30+ most popular open source models that can be hosted directly in GALE. 

Additionally, if you want to bring in open-source models from Hugging Face, you can enable that option in GALE. For more information about How to enable Hugging Face in GALE, see [How to Enable Hugging Face](../../integrations/how-to-enable-hugging-face.md).
