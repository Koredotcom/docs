# Fine-Tuned Models

Fine-tuning a pre-existing model is a common approach in creating fine-tuned models. By starting with a pre-trained model, which has its functions and knowledge, and building on top of it, you can save time and resources. Fine-tuning involves training the model on your specific dataset or domain to adapt it to your needs. This way, you can leverage the knowledge and features learned by the pre-trained model while tailoring it to your data and requirements.
