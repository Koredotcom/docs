# External Models

GALE offers flexible options for integrating external models such as Open AI, Anthropic, Azure Open AI, Cohere, and Google.

The integration is done in 2 ways:

* Through the Easy integration method, you can choose a model from a commercial provider such as Open AI, Anthropic, or Google and use the respective API key provided by the provider. For more information, see [Add an External Model using Easy Integration](./add-an-external-model-using-easy-integration.md).
* Alternatively, if you hosted your model externally, GALE provides a custom API integration method to seamlessly incorporate it into the platform. For more information, see [Add an External Model using API Integration](../external-models/add-an-external-model-using-api-integration.md).

With these options, GALE empowers you to leverage the full potential of your preferred models while enjoying the benefits of our platform's advanced capabilities.
