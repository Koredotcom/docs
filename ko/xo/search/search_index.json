It can be installed with:</p> <pre><code>pip install mkdocs-exclude-search\n</code></pre> <p>How it works: the plugin post-processes the <code>search_index.json</code> file that is generated by the built-in search plugin, giving the author the ability to exclude certain pages and sections by adding a few lines of configuration to <code>mkdocs.yml</code>.

While this is a very powerful idea, it comes with some downsides:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Exclusion patterns and content are not co-located: exclusion patterns     need to be defined in <code>mkdocs.yml</code>, and not as part of the respective     document or section to be excluded.

Linking is necessary, as search results are grouped by page.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tokenization: The <code>title</code> and <code>text</code> values of each section are split     into tokens by using the <code>separator</code> as configured in     <code>mkdocs.yml</code>. Tokenization itself is carried out by     lunr's default tokenizer, which doesn't allow for     lookahead or separators spanning multiple characters.</p> <p>Why is this important and a big deal? We will see later how much more we can achieve with a tokenizer that is capable of separating strings with lookahead.</p> </li> <li> <p>Indexing: As a final step, each section is indexed. When querying the     index, if a search query includes one of the tokens as returned by step 2.,     the section is considered to be part of the search result and passed to the     main thread.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Now, that's basically how the search worker operates. Sure, there's a little more magic involved, e.g., search results are post-processed and rescored to account for some shortcomings of lunr, but in general, this is how data gets into and out of the index.</p>"},{"location":"blog/posts/search-better-faster-smaller/#search-previews","title":"Search previews","text":"<p>Users should be able to quickly scan and evaluate the relevance of a search result in the given context, which is why a concise summary with highlighted occurrences of the search terms found is an essential part of a great search experience.</p> <p>This is where the current search preview generation falls short, as some of the search previews appear not to include any occurrence of any of the search terms.

As the project grew over time, we found that maintaining and managing the overhead that comes with growth became more challenging and time-consuming.</p> <p>In order to sustain the project and add new and useful features more frequently, we decided to create the Insiders edition, with early access to the latest and greatest features of Material for MkDocs. The subscription-based model of the Insiders edition allows us to dedicate more time and resources to the project, which benefits all  users of Material for MkDocs. Once our funding goals based on monthly  subscriptions are hit, the Insiders features of those^ funding goals are released  to the community edition, letting everyone benefit from them. </p> <p>Maintaining both the community and Insiders editions is an ongoing process, and  we rely on our sponsors to support us on a monthly basis, which makes this whole  project possible.</p> <p>What features are included in the Insiders edition?</p> <p>The Insiders edition includes more than 20 additional features. You can find an  overview of these features on our Insiders page, which is updated when new features are added and released.</p> <p>How often is the Insiders edition updated?</p> <p>We try to keep our open issue count low, fixing known bugs quickly.

You can support Material for MkDocs by sponsoring us on Ko-fi, regardless of whether you have a GitHub account or not. However, please note that Insiders is provided as a private repository on GitHub. If after sponsoring, you'd like to gain access to the repository, you'll need to have a GitHub individual or bot account that can be added as a collaborator. If your organization doesn't use GitHub or/and host its repositories on other platforms, you can mirror the Insiders repository in your environment once you have access.</p> <p>Which sponsoring tier should I choose?</p> <p>The sponsoring tiers are divided into non-commercial and commercial tiers. If  you are an individual or organization using Material for MkDocs for private or non-commercial Open Source projects, you have two tiers to choose from,  depending on the number of sites you want to build. For companies using  Material for MkDocs, we offer three different commercial tiers, from which  you can choose depending on your requirements.</p> <p>Also, please read what is considered commercial use.</p> <p>Why are one-time sponsorships not granted access to Insiders?</p> <p>Primarily due to technical reasons, that we're working on lifting in the future. We use GitHub webhooks to determine our current active sponsors. When you create or cancel your monthly subscription, GitHub sends events that we use to automatically add and remove collaborators.</p> <p>Note that $15 is the minimum amount to be granted access to Insiders.</p> <p>How is my sponsorship contribution used to support the project?</p> <p>Your sponsorship contribution directly supports the development and  maintenance of the project, by buying us maintainers time. It allows us to dedicate more time and resources to enhance the project's features and functionality. The additional funding helps us prioritize improvements and updates, benefiting Insiders users and the wider community. We also actively contribute to other upstream projects, fostering collaboration and giving back to the Open Source ecosystem.</p> <p>Are there any limitations on the number of sponsors for a particular tier?</p> <p>No, there are no limitations on the number of sponsors for any tier.

If you decide to cancel, your sponsorship will remain active until  the end of your billing cycle.</p> <p>What payment options do you accept?</p> <p>We manage all our transactions and sponsorships through GitHub Sponsors and  Ko-fi. To become a sponsor of Material for MkDocs on GitHub, visit  our sponsors' page. On there, you can choose from five different sponsorship  tiers and pay by credit card. Please note that as of the beginning of 2023,  GitHub no longer supports PayPal payments. If you wish to pay with PayPal,  ou can find a selection of our sponsorship tiers on Ko-fi.

To ensure that everyone can afford the Insiders program  and keep the barrier as low as possible, we have set prices as low as $15 a month for non-commercial use.</p> <p>Do you offer free access to Insiders for Open Source projects?</p> <p>No, we do not offer free access to our Material for MkDocs Insiders edition.  We understand that non-profit organizations may have limited budgets and may  need to prioritize their spending on other projects or organizations. However, it's important to note that Material for MkDocs is maintained by a small team,  investing a lot of time and resources into constantly improving this project.  Material for MkDocs and its core features are free to the community through our  Open Source model. Therefore, Material for MkDocs itself is already free.</p> <p>However, we do offer an affordable sponsorship tier starting at $15 a month,  which is meant for individuals and non-profit organizations using Material for  MkDocs to build 1-2 sites for non-commercial purposes. This tier provides access  to all new features, benefiting you from our ongoing development efforts.</p> <p>Is Insiders free for those who contribute to this project?</p> <p>Great question! We can not offer free access to \"drive-by\" contributors that  only fix minor issues like typos or add new languages. These contributions are  always welcome, but as we need to review them, they result in a higher time  investment from our side and don't compensate for this work. However, as this  project keeps growing, we always seek for individuals to support us. In return,  we offer financial compensation or/and Insiders access.

Depending on  your billing cycle you automatically become a monthly or yearly sponsor. Your  billing cycle is an account-level setting that you can easily change in your  account. If, for some reason, you cannot make this change, you can create a  dedicated bot account with a yearly billing cycle on GitHub, which you only use  for sponsoring (some sponsors already do that). If you have any problems or  further questions, please contact us at sponsors@squidfunk.com.</p> <p>Can I get an invoice for my sponsorship payment?</p> <p>Right now, we can't provide you with an invoice for your sponsoring transaction, as GitHub Sponsors handles all transactions for us. However, both payment platforms, GitHub and Ko-Fi, automatically send you a payment receipt  via mail once the sponsorship is active.</p> <p>Furthermore, we are working on a solution to optimize access management and more features. If you are interested in this, please get in touch with us via mail at sponsors@squidfunk.com or turn on all notifications for MkDocs, and we will reach out as soon as we are live.</p> <p>Can I switch between different sponsoring tiers?</p> <p>Yes, you can switch between different sponsoring tiers at any time. Simply go  to the GitHub Sponsors page and change your sponsoring tier. Once you make  that change, you will immediately change to the new tier.</p> <p>If you change to a higher tier, the amount will be prorated according to your billing cycle.</p> <p>Can I sponsor the project for a specific feature or development goal?</p> <p>While sponsoring specific goals directly is not possible, our sponsoring goals are connected to specific features or development goals aligned with the  project's roadmap. You can find an overview of these sponsoring goals and their  associated features on our website. Insider users have early access to all  already developed features, including those associated with higher funding goals  that will be reached at a later stage. If you're interested in accessing these  features, becoming a sponsor is the way to go. If you have a feature in mind  that you would like to see on the list, we encourage you to  initiate a new discussion to evaluate it with others.</p> <p>What happens if I reach my sponsoring limit for my current tier?</p> <p>If you extend the number of sites that are in your current sponsoring limit,  please upgrade your sponsorship to a higher tier to continue using the  Insiders version and build more sites. The change will be effective immediately.</p> <p>Do you offer refunds for sponsoring payments?</p> <p>Unfortunately, we cannot offer any refund for sponsorship payments.  GitHub Sponsors and Ko-Fi manage all sponsoring transactions. Because of  that, we do not have any insights into the details of the funds and cannot access  them. If you have any payment issues, please get in touch with the GitHub  or Ko-Fi support team, as they can help you.</p>"},{"location":"faq/sponsoring/#access-management","title":"Access management","text":"<p>How do I gain access to the private Insiders repository?</p> <p>If you sponsored with your individual account, you should have received an  email invitation to the private Material for MkDocs Insiders repository right  after you initiated your sponsorship.

If you are using the Insiders edition as an individual, you can work directly with the private repository, as you do not need to share the Insiders features with others. If you are working with a team, it is best to create a private fork using the individual account you listed as a collaborator of Material for MkDocs to grant access to all members of your organization to your fork.</p> <p>Can I share my Insiders access with others?</p> <p>At the moment, it is not possible to directly share your collaborator status  for the private Insiders repository with other accounts. However, if you are  working with a team and would like them to access Insiders, you can share the  Insiders repository by utilizing options such as cloning, forking, or  mirroring. By doing so, you can start collaborating with your team members on  the new repository you have shared.

Insiders is compatible with Material for MkDocs. Almost all new features and configuration options are either backward-compatible or implemented behind feature flags. When working with outside collaborators, changing the general  appearance of your site should be optional. Most Insiders features enhance the  overall experience, e.g., by adding icons to pages or providing a feedback  widget. While these features add value for your site's users, they should be  optional for previewing when making changes to content. Currently, the only  content-related features in Insiders that non-Insiders users can't properly  preview are Annotations and Card grids.</p> <p>This means that outside collaborators can build the documentation locally with  Material for MkDocs, and when they push their changes, your CI pipeline will  build it with Insiders. When using built-in plugins exclusive to Insiders, it's  recommended to split configuration into a base <code>mkdocs.yml</code> and one with plugin  overrides via configuration inheritance.</p> <p>See the getting started guide for more information.</p>"},{"location":"faq/sponsoring/#support","title":"Support","text":"<p>How can I contact support if I have questions about becoming a sponsor? </p> <p>If you have any questions and would like to contact us before starting your  sponsorship, we are happy to answer all your non-technical questions about the  Insiders program via email at sponsors@squidfunk.com.</p> <p>All technical questions should be asked openly on our discussion board.</p> <p>Is additional support available for Material for MkDocs Insiders users?</p> <p>Yes, we provide non-technical support related to sponsoring at sponsors@squidfunk.com.

As a small team working on Material for MkDocs, we have limited resources and cannot review  and sign agreements.</p> <p>Can I sponsor privately?</p> <p>Yes, you can. GitHub gives you the option to set your sponsorship to private  when you set up your sponsorship. Additionally, we have a recommended workflow  for you: We suggest you create a new GitHub bot account. This bot account should  not be tied to a particular individual and should be privately listed as an  owner of your GitHub organization. This account can then be used to sponsor  Material for MkDocs privately. As a bot account, it will automatically be listed  as a collaborator of the private Insiders repository. You can clone, fork, or  mirror using this account. All information will be kept confidential; only the  bot account and us maintainers will have insights into his sponsorship. </p> <p>Are there any geographical restrictions on becoming a sponsor?</p> <p>No, there are no geographical restrictions for becoming a sponsor.

This means you can store and edit unoptimized files outside of your repository, and let both plugins built a highly optimized site for you.</p> <p>If you want to implement separate pipelines, i.e., optimize some images differently from others or exclude some images from downloading, you can use multiple instances of the built-in privacy plugin.</p> <code>assets_exclude</code> <p> Default: none \u2013 This option allows to exclude certain external assets from processing by the privacy plugin, so they will not be downloaded and bundled during the build:</p> <pre><code>plugins:\n  - privacy:\n      assets_exclude: # (1)!\n        - cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/* \n        - giscus.app/*\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> <p>MathJax loads web fonts for typesetting of mathematical content     through relative URLs, and thus cannot be automatically bundled by the     privacy plugin.

Most of the fonts include several weights and are split up into different character sets  to keep the download size small, so the browser only downloads what is really needed. For Roboto, our default regular font, this results in 42 <code>*.woff2</code> files in total.</p> <p>If Material for MkDocs would bundle all font files, the download size would be in the hundreds of megabytes, slowing down automated builds. Furthermore,  authors might add external assets like third-party scripts or style sheets  that would need to be remembered to be defined as further local assets.</p> <p>This is the very reason the built-in privacy plugin exists \u2014 it automates the process of downloading all external assets manually to ensure compliance with GDPR with some some technical limitations.</p>"},{"location":"setup/ensuring-data-privacy/#external-links","title":"External links","text":"<p> Sponsors only \u00b7  insiders-4.26.0 \u00b7  Experimental</p> <p>The following configuration options are available for external links:</p> <code>links</code> <p> Default: <code>true</code> \u2013 This option specifies whether the plugin should parse and process external links.
