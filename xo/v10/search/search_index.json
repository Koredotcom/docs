With the new tokenization   technique, we laid the groundwork for more sophisticated shortening and   summarization methods, which we're tackling next.</p> </li> <li> <p>User interface improvements: as we now gained full control over the   search plugin, we can now add meaningful metadata to provide more context and   a better experience. We'll explore some of those paths in the future.</p> </li> </ul> <p>If you've made it this far, thank you for your time and interest in Material for MkDocs!

You're invited to leave a comment to share your experiences with the new search implementation.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Prior to  5.0.0, search was carried out in the main thread  which locked up the browser, rendering it unusable. This problem was first reported in #904 and, after some back and forth, fixed and released in  5.0.0.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>At the time of writing, Just the Docs and Docusaurus use this method for generating search previews.

However, the <code>+</code> is completely irrelevant, as regular expression groups involving multiple characters were never supported by lunr's default tokenizer.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Previously, the search query was not correctly tokenized due to the way lunr treats wildcards, as it disables the pipeline for search terms that  contain wildcards. In order to provide a good typeahead experience, Material for MkDocs adds wildcards to the end of each search term not explicitly preceded with <code>+</code> or <code>-</code>, effectively disabling tokenization.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Using the separator as defined in <code>mkdocs.yml</code>, a regular expression was constructed that was trying to mimic the tokenizer. As an example, the search query <code>search highlight</code> was transformed into the rather cumbersome regular expression <code>(^|&lt;separator&gt;)(search|highlight)</code>, which only matches at word boundaries.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Smallest value of ten distinct runs.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>We agnostically use KJV Markdown as a tool for testing to learn how Material for MkDocs behaves on large corpora, as it's a very large set of Markdown files with over 800k words.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"blog/posts/the-past-present-and-future/","title":"The past, present and future","text":"<p>2021 was a fantastic year for this project as we shipped many new awesome features, saw significant user growth and leveraged GitHub Sponsors to make the project sustainable.</p> <p>Today, together, MkDocs and Material for MkDocs are among the most popular options when it comes to choosing a static site generator and theme for your technical documentation project.

I wanted to release my latest Open Source project protobluff, a zero-copy Protocol Buffers implementation for C, which I've created as part of my former startup. As the project has a significant degree of complexity, I quickly realized that I was in need of good user documentation.</p> <p>After evaluating static site generators in general and Hugo, Sphinx and MkDocs in particular, I quickly decided that MkDocs seemed a good choice, as it was specifically aimed at technical project documentation and easy to use. Unfortunately, all of the available themes looked dated and given that I'm a very visual person, I just couldn't convince myself to call it a day.</p> <p>I had to build a theme.</p> <p>Months later, in February 2016, I released the first version of Material for MkDocs (and with it, protobluff, the project I wanted to release in the first place), and it looked like this:</p> <p></p> <p>It was already fully responsive and overall, well, quite okayish, but barely customizable, as only the logo could be changed. Beyond that, it had no options: No color or navigation options, no instant loading, etc. The search was very rudimentary and only supported section titles:</p> <p></p> <p>It's important to know that at this point in time I've built Material for MkDocs for protobluff, the project I was really caring about. Almost 6 years later, nobody knows protobluff, but this little side project has taken off. If back in those days, you would've told me big organizations like AWS, Microsoft and CERN, as well as extremely popular Open Source projects like FastAPI and Kubernetes will be using this project in the future \u2013 I would've declared you insane.</p> <p>I still find the success of this project quite surprising, as I thought that themes exist in abundance and are very much a solved problem. There's no glory in themes, no stars to earn (remember that I was new in Open Source, so this was the metric I was optimizing for), as there are thousands and thousands of options. However, as the years progressed, I learned that execution matters: although Material for MkDocs solves a problem for which thousands of solutions exist, it excels in a specific niche, and that niche is to be known as technical project documentation.</p> <p>Today, this project is not only popular but funded by almost 300 individuals and organizations, resulting in a yearly budget of more than $50,000. This allows me to set aside enough time for the development of new features, bug fixing, stability improvement, issue triage and general support and still feels like a dream to me, as there are many failed stories of Open Source funding and people telling you: don't do Open Source, you'll be working for free.</p> <p>Making Open Source sustainable is, after all, possible in 2021.</p>"},{"location":"blog/posts/the-past-present-and-future/#2021-in-numbers","title":"2021 in numbers","text":"<p>2021 was an exciting year, as the project has seen significant growth.</p> <p>166k people visited the official documentation in 2021, totalling in 1,6m page views which is an increase of 83% when compared to 2020.

As the project grew over time, we found that maintaining and managing the overhead that comes with growth became more challenging and time-consuming.</p> <p>In order to sustain the project and add new and useful features more frequently, we decided to create the Insiders edition, with early access to the latest and greatest features of Material for MkDocs. The subscription-based model of the Insiders edition allows us to dedicate more time and resources to the project, which benefits all  users of Material for MkDocs. Once our funding goals based on monthly  subscriptions are hit, the Insiders features of those^ funding goals are released  to the community edition, letting everyone benefit from them. </p> <p>Maintaining both the community and Insiders editions is an ongoing process, and  we rely on our sponsors to support us on a monthly basis, which makes this whole  project possible.</p> <p>What features are included in the Insiders edition?</p> <p>The Insiders edition includes more than 20 additional features. You can find an  overview of these features on our Insiders page, which is updated when new features are added and released.</p> <p>How often is the Insiders edition updated?</p> <p>We try to keep our open issue count low, fixing known bugs quickly.

You can support Material for MkDocs by sponsoring us on Ko-fi, regardless of whether you have a GitHub account or not. However, please note that Insiders is provided as a private repository on GitHub. If after sponsoring, you'd like to gain access to the repository, you'll need to have a GitHub individual or bot account that can be added as a collaborator. If your organization doesn't use GitHub or/and host its repositories on other platforms, you can mirror the Insiders repository in your environment once you have access.</p> <p>Which sponsoring tier should I choose?</p> <p>The sponsoring tiers are divided into non-commercial and commercial tiers. If  you are an individual or organization using Material for MkDocs for private or non-commercial Open Source projects, you have two tiers to choose from,  depending on the number of sites you want to build. For companies using  Material for MkDocs, we offer three different commercial tiers, from which  you can choose depending on your requirements.</p> <p>Also, please read what is considered commercial use.</p> <p>Why are one-time sponsorships not granted access to Insiders?</p> <p>Primarily due to technical reasons, that we're working on lifting in the future. We use GitHub webhooks to determine our current active sponsors. When you create or cancel your monthly subscription, GitHub sends events that we use to automatically add and remove collaborators.</p> <p>Note that $15 is the minimum amount to be granted access to Insiders.</p> <p>How is my sponsorship contribution used to support the project?</p> <p>Your sponsorship contribution directly supports the development and  maintenance of the project, by buying us maintainers time. It allows us to dedicate more time and resources to enhance the project's features and functionality. The additional funding helps us prioritize improvements and updates, benefiting Insiders users and the wider community. We also actively contribute to other upstream projects, fostering collaboration and giving back to the Open Source ecosystem.</p> <p>Are there any limitations on the number of sponsors for a particular tier?</p> <p>No, there are no limitations on the number of sponsors for any tier. You can sponsor the project at any tier regardless of how many other sponsors are already there.</p>"},{"location":"faq/sponsoring/#payment-billing","title":"Payment &amp; billing","text":"<p>Is there a trial period for the Insiders edition?</p> <p>No, we do not offer a trial period for the Insiders edition. However, if you're a company and are considering sponsoring on the commercial tier, but want to first give the Insiders edition a try, you can sponsor on the $15 tier with a personal account for non-commercial evaluation purposes.</p> <p>Additionally, our subscription model allows you to cancel your sponsorship anytime. If you decide to cancel, your sponsorship will remain active until  the end of your billing cycle.</p> <p>What payment options do you accept?</p> <p>We manage all our transactions and sponsorships through GitHub Sponsors and  Ko-fi. To become a sponsor of Material for MkDocs on GitHub, visit  our sponsors' page. On there, you can choose from five different sponsorship  tiers and pay by credit card. Please note that as of the beginning of 2023,  GitHub no longer supports PayPal payments. If you wish to pay with PayPal,  ou can find a selection of our sponsorship tiers on Ko-fi. Both platforms provide you with a payment receipt once your purchase is successful.</p> <p>If you're a company and need assistance choosing the right payment method, please don't hesitate to reach out to sponsors@squidfunk.com.</p> <p>Are discounts available for the Insiders edition, such as student discounts?</p> <p>Unfortunately, we are not able to offer any discounts for the Material for  MkDocs Insiders program. To ensure that everyone can afford the Insiders program  and keep the barrier as low as possible, we have set prices as low as $15 a month for non-commercial use.</p> <p>Do you offer free access to Insiders for Open Source projects?</p> <p>No, we do not offer free access to our Material for MkDocs Insiders edition.  We understand that non-profit organizations may have limited budgets and may  need to prioritize their spending on other projects or organizations. However, it's important to note that Material for MkDocs is maintained by a small team,  investing a lot of time and resources into constantly improving this project.  Material for MkDocs and its core features are free to the community through our  Open Source model. Therefore, Material for MkDocs itself is already free.</p> <p>However, we do offer an affordable sponsorship tier starting at $15 a month,  which is meant for individuals and non-profit organizations using Material for  MkDocs to build 1-2 sites for non-commercial purposes. This tier provides access  to all new features, benefiting you from our ongoing development efforts.</p> <p>Is Insiders free for those who contribute to this project?</p> <p>Great question! We can not offer free access to \"drive-by\" contributors that  only fix minor issues like typos or add new languages. These contributions are  always welcome, but as we need to review them, they result in a higher time  investment from our side and don't compensate for this work. However, as this  project keeps growing, we always seek for individuals to support us. In return,  we offer financial compensation or/and Insiders access.

Depending on  your billing cycle you automatically become a monthly or yearly sponsor. Your  billing cycle is an account-level setting that you can easily change in your  account. If, for some reason, you cannot make this change, you can create a  dedicated bot account with a yearly billing cycle on GitHub, which you only use  for sponsoring (some sponsors already do that). If you have any problems or  further questions, please contact us at sponsors@squidfunk.com.</p> <p>Can I get an invoice for my sponsorship payment?</p> <p>Right now, we can't provide you with an invoice for your sponsoring transaction, as GitHub Sponsors handles all transactions for us. However, both payment platforms, GitHub and Ko-Fi, automatically send you a payment receipt  via mail once the sponsorship is active.</p> <p>Furthermore, we are working on a solution to optimize access management and more features. If you are interested in this, please get in touch with us via mail at sponsors@squidfunk.com or turn on all notifications for MkDocs, and we will reach out as soon as we are live.</p> <p>Can I switch between different sponsoring tiers?</p> <p>Yes, you can switch between different sponsoring tiers at any time. Simply go  to the GitHub Sponsors page and change your sponsoring tier. Once you make  that change, you will immediately change to the new tier.</p> <p>If you change to a higher tier, the amount will be prorated according to your billing cycle.</p> <p>Can I sponsor the project for a specific feature or development goal?</p> <p>While sponsoring specific goals directly is not possible, our sponsoring goals are connected to specific features or development goals aligned with the  project's roadmap. You can find an overview of these sponsoring goals and their  associated features on our website. Insider users have early access to all  already developed features, including those associated with higher funding goals  that will be reached at a later stage. If you're interested in accessing these  features, becoming a sponsor is the way to go. If you have a feature in mind  that you would like to see on the list, we encourage you to  initiate a new discussion to evaluate it with others.</p> <p>What happens if I reach my sponsoring limit for my current tier?</p> <p>If you extend the number of sites that are in your current sponsoring limit,  please upgrade your sponsorship to a higher tier to continue using the  Insiders version and build more sites. The change will be effective immediately.</p> <p>Do you offer refunds for sponsoring payments?</p> <p>Unfortunately, we cannot offer any refund for sponsorship payments.  GitHub Sponsors and Ko-Fi manage all sponsoring transactions. Because of  that, we do not have any insights into the details of the funds and cannot access  them. If you have any payment issues, please get in touch with the GitHub  or Ko-Fi support team, as they can help you.</p>"},{"location":"faq/sponsoring/#access-management","title":"Access management","text":"<p>How do I gain access to the private Insiders repository?</p> <p>If you sponsored with your individual account, you should have received an  email invitation to the private Material for MkDocs Insiders repository right  after you initiated your sponsorship.

If you are using the Insiders edition as an individual, you can work directly with the private repository, as you do not need to share the Insiders features with others. If you are working with a team, it is best to create a private fork using the individual account you listed as a collaborator of Material for MkDocs to grant access to all members of your organization to your fork.</p> <p>Can I share my Insiders access with others?</p> <p>At the moment, it is not possible to directly share your collaborator status  for the private Insiders repository with other accounts. However, if you are  working with a team and would like them to access Insiders, you can share the  Insiders repository by utilizing options such as cloning, forking, or  mirroring. By doing so, you can start collaborating with your team members on  the new repository you have shared.

This includes any use by a corporation or other organization, whether  or not they generate revenue directly from the software. We offer different  pricing tiers for commercial use, each tailored to the needs of different  businesses. It's important to note that internal use of the software within your  organization is also considered commercial use, as with all commercial software.</p> <p>What constitutes non-commercial use of the Insiders version?</p> <p>Non-commercial use of our Material for MkDocs refers to private use. This includes individuals using the Insiders edition for private or purely non-commercial Open Source projects. We offer two different tiers for non-commercial use, depending on the number of sites you want to build.  </p> <p>What is your fair use policy?</p> <p>Our fair use policy includes the following guidelines:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Please refrain from distributing the source code of Insiders. While you  may use the software for public, private, or commercial projects and may  privately fork or mirror it, we ask that you keep the source code private. This  is important to our sponsorware strategy, which helps us fund ongoing  development and support of the software.

Insiders is compatible with Material for MkDocs. Almost all new features and configuration options are either backward-compatible or implemented behind feature flags. When working with outside collaborators, changing the general  appearance of your site should be optional. Most Insiders features enhance the  overall experience, e.g., by adding icons to pages or providing a feedback  widget. While these features add value for your site's users, they should be  optional for previewing when making changes to content. Currently, the only  content-related features in Insiders that non-Insiders users can't properly  preview are Annotations and Card grids.</p> <p>This means that outside collaborators can build the documentation locally with  Material for MkDocs, and when they push their changes, your CI pipeline will  build it with Insiders. When using built-in plugins exclusive to Insiders, it's  recommended to split configuration into a base <code>mkdocs.yml</code> and one with plugin  overrides via configuration inheritance.</p> <p>See the getting started guide for more information.</p>"},{"location":"faq/sponsoring/#support","title":"Support","text":"<p>How can I contact support if I have questions about becoming a sponsor? </p> <p>If you have any questions and would like to contact us before starting your  sponsorship, we are happy to answer all your non-technical questions about the  Insiders program via email at sponsors@squidfunk.com.</p> <p>All technical questions should be asked openly on our discussion board.</p> <p>Is additional support available for Material for MkDocs Insiders users?</p> <p>Yes, we provide non-technical support related to sponsoring at sponsors@squidfunk.com.

Is this still possible?</p> <p>Yes. Insiders is compatible with Material for MkDocs. Almost all new features and configuration options are either backward-compatible or implemented behind feature flags. When working with outside collaborators, it should be rarely necessary to change the general appearance of your site. Most Insiders features enhance the overall experience, e.g. by adding icons to pages or providing a feedback widget. While this features add value for the user of your site, they shouldn't be necessary for previewing when making changes to content. Currently, the only content-related features in Insiders that can't be properly previewed by non-Insiders users are:</p> <ul> <li>Annotations</li> <li>Card grids</li> </ul> <p>This means that outside collaborators are able to build the documentation locally with Material for MkDocs and when they push their changes, your CI pipeline will build it with Insiders. When using built-in plugins that are exclusive to Insiders, it's recommended to split configuration into a base <code>mkdocs.yml</code> and one with plugin overrides via configuration inheritance.</p> <p>See the getting started guide for more information.</p>"},{"location":"insiders/#payment","title":"Payment","text":"<p>We don't want to pay for sponsorship every month.

Whether you're an individual or a company, you may use Material for MkDocs Insiders precisely under the same terms as Material for MkDocs, which are given by the MIT license. However, we kindly ask you to respect our fair use policy:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Please don't distribute the source code of Insiders. You may freely use   it for public, private or commercial projects, privately fork or mirror it,   but please don't make the source code public, as it would counteract the    sponsorware strategy.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you cancel your subscription, you're automatically removed as a   collaborator and will miss out on all future updates of Insiders. However, you   may use the latest version that's available to you as long as you like.   Just remember that GitHub deletes private forks.</p> </li> </ul> <ol> <li> <p>In general, every new feature is first exclusively released to sponsors, but sometimes upstream dependencies like Python Markdown Extensions enhance existing features that must be supported by Material for MkDocs.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Note that $15 a month is the minimum amount to become eligible for Insiders. While GitHub Sponsors also allows to sponsor lower amounts or one-time amounts, those can't be granted access to Insiders due to technical reasons.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Making an Open Source project sustainable is exceptionally hard: maintainers burn out, projects are abandoned. That's not great and very unpredictable. The sponsorware model ensures that if you decide to use Material for MkDocs, you can be sure that bugs are fixed quickly and new features are added regularly.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>It's currently not possible to grant access to each member of an organization, as GitHub only allows for adding users. Thus, after sponsoring, please send an email to sponsors@squidfunk.com, stating which account should become a collaborator of the Insiders repository. We're working on a solution which will make access to organizations much simpler. To ensure that access is not tied to a particular individual GitHub account, create a bot account (i.e. a GitHub account that is not tied to a specific individual), and use this account for the sponsoring. After being added to the list of collaborators, the bot account can create a private fork of the private Insiders GitHub repository, and grant access to all members of the organizations.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>If you cancel your sponsorship, GitHub schedules a cancellation request which will become effective at the end of the billing cycle. This means that even though you cancel your sponsorship, you will keep your access to Insiders as long as your cancellation isn't effective. All charges are processed by GitHub through Stripe. As we don't receive any information regarding your payment, and GitHub doesn't offer refunds, sponsorships are non-refundable.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li>

This means you can store and edit unoptimized files outside of your repository, and let both plugins built a highly optimized site for you.</p> <p>If you want to implement separate pipelines, i.e., optimize some images differently from others or exclude some images from downloading, you can use multiple instances of the built-in privacy plugin.</p> <code>assets_exclude</code> <p> Default: none \u2013 This option allows to exclude certain external assets from processing by the privacy plugin, so they will not be downloaded and bundled during the build:</p> <pre><code>plugins:\n- privacy:\nassets_exclude: # (1)!\n- cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/* - giscus.app/*\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> <p>MathJax loads web fonts for typesetting of mathematical content     through relative URLs, and thus cannot be automatically bundled by the     privacy plugin.

Most of the fonts include several weights and are split up into different character sets  to keep the download size small, so the browser only downloads what is really needed. For Roboto, our default regular font, this results in 42 <code>*.woff2</code> files in total.</p> <p>If Material for MkDocs would bundle all font files, the download size would be in the hundreds of megabytes, slowing down automated builds.
