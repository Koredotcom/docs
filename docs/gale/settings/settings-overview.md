# Settings Console Overview

GALE’s **Settings** console is a centralized management interface that provides administrators with the tools and functionalities to configure, monitor, and manage GALE’s system configurations to manage the following:

1. [Users](../settings/user-management/users.md){:target="_blank"}
2. [Roles and permissions](../settings/user-management/role-management.md){:target="_blank"}
3. [Automated synchronization](../settings/user-management/settings/active-directory.md/#step-4-schedule-automatic-ad-sync){:target="_blank"} of user data from Enterprise AD, plus configuration of user profile fields and email notifications.
4. [Easy Integration](../models/external-models/add-an-external-model-using-easy-integration.md){:target="_blank"} and [API Integration](../models/external-models/add-an-external-model-using-api-integration.md){:target="_blank"}
5. [Manage Guardrails](../agents/guardrails/manage-guardrails.md){:target="_blank"} 
6. [Monitoring](../settings/monitoring/overview.md){:target="_blank"}: [Audit Logs](./monitoring/audit-logs.md){:target="_blank"}

## Levels of Users Management 

The **Settings** Console provides administrators comprehensive control and visibility on the user management features available at the following levels, facilitating proactive and improved management.

* **Account level**: At the account level, administrators can manage users, their roles, and permissions throughout the entire GALE account. This includes tasks such as inviting users, establishing automatic data synchronization from the enterprise Active Directory (AD), and setting up access controls for modules including agent creation, model management (including access, deployment, and export), integrations, user management, audit logs, security controls, model guardrails, and others.

* **Agent level**: User management within the GALE platform is focused on agent management, emphasizing individual agent deployments and configurations. Each agent's owner has the authority to invite individual users, customize their permissions and access levels, and manage tasks such as creating and deleting agents, assigning roles, overseeing deployments, configuring guardrails, and managing API keys.

This post describes how to access the **Settings** Console and summarizes the modules and features available.

## Actions You Can Perform on the Settings Console

The modules and the capabilities supported on the <b>Settings</b> Console include the following:

**Users**

* Add a new user to your account and assign a system role to them via email invitation or user information file import.
* View and track the summary of counts for total, active, inactive, and locked users.
* View the details of all the users linked to your account like Name, Email ID, Account Role, and Status.
* Select and delete one or more users from your account.
* Unlock the locked users.
* Reassign a default or custom role to a user.

[Learn more](../settings/user-management/users.md){:target="_blank"} about this feature.

**Roles and Permissions**

* View system-generated roles for <b>account</b> and <b>agent</b> role types.
* Duplicate the roles and make custom changes.
* View the enabled/disabled access controls for various modules and permissions for system roles.
* Add new custom roles for agent and account types, enable/disable access, and set access controls (full, view, custom, and no access) for various modules and permissions assigned to the roles. 

[Learn more](../settings/user-management/role-management.md){:target="_blank"} about this feature.

**Settings**

[Sync and import key user information](../settings/user-management/settings/active-directory.md){:target="_blank"} from your organization's AD by doing the following: 

* Configuring the connection to your AD.
* Importing user data from all or specific organization units.
* Selecting and managing default AD user fields, or adding custom fields, and defining inclusion and exclusion rules for data import and sync.
* Configuring AD auto sync schedules to ensure user data on GALE remains up-to-date.

Additionally, you can do the following:

* View sync history and reports to monitor successful and failed AD syncs.
* Manage the ability to view and edit default and custom user data fields.
* Configure how joining requests from new users are handled, including automatic approval options.
* Choose whether users should receive email notifications upon being added to your account via email invitation or AD sync.

**Integrations**

Integrate connections for [Weights & Biases](../settings/integrations/integrate-with-wandb.md){:target="_blank"}, [AWS S3 Bucket](../settings/integrations/integrate-with-s3-bucket.md){:target="_blank"}, and [Hugging Face](../settings/integrations/enable-hugging-face.md){:target="_blank"} using API or App credentials. 

**Guardrails**

Deploy and undeploy guardrail models to apply scanners to prompt input and output text across all agents. [Learn more](../agents/guardrails/manage-guardrails.md){:target="_blank"}.

**Monitoring**

- Track the audit logs of user actions within your account to gain insights into their activities. [Learn more](../settings/monitoring/audit-logs.md){:target="_blank"}.
- Review agent performance metrics and take informed decisions on the **Agent Analytics** dashboard.
