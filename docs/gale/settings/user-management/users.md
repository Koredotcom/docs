# Users

The **Users** feature simplifies account administration through centralized tools for inviting, importing, and managing users. The tools work together to streamline user administration and ensure efficient collaboration, access control, and status monitoring.

**Key Features**

* **User Invitation**: Easily invite individual users or groups via email.
* **Invitation Management**: Resend invitations for users who haven't yet joined.
* **Bulk Import**: Add multiple users efficiently by uploading CSV or TXT files.
* **Active Directory Sync**: Synchronize user data directly from your organization's Active Directory.
* **Role Management**: Assign and reassign user roles to control access and permissions.
* **Status Tracking**: Monitor user statuses (active, inactive, locked) from a centralized dashboard.
* **Account Unlocking**: Quickly unlock user accounts that have been locked due to failed login attempts.
* **User Search**: Easily find specific users using the search functionality.
* **User Deletion**: Remove individual or multiple users from your GALE account as needed.

**Best Practices**

* Regularly review and update user roles.
* Use bulk import to add multiple users efficiently.
* Monitor the locked users and inactive invitations.
* Maintain users for effective account management.

## Users Dashboard

The dashboard displays user counts by status:

* **Active**: Users with active accounts who can interact with other GALE users.
* **Inactive**: Users invited by the admin but who have yet to join or accept the invitation.
* **Locked**: Users who have exceeded 5 failed login attempts and their accounts have been locked.

It also shows detailed user information, including name, email, role, and status. For information on default system roles, click [here](../user-management/role-management.md/#system-defined-roles){:target="_blank"}.

## Add a New User

The  **Settings** Console provides two ways to add a new user to the system:

* Email invitation
* Import _.txt_ or _.csv_ file with user information in the predefined format.

### Invite (Email Invitation)

Click [here](../../getting-started/sign-up-sign-in.md/#invite-a-user-to-your-account){:target="_blank"} to see the step-by-step instructions on how to add a user via email invitation.

### Resend Invite

Invitations expire after 15 days. You can send a new email invitation to the user. [Learn more](../../getting-started/sign-up-sign-in.md/#resend-email-invitation){:target="_blank"}.

### Import (Bulk Import)

The import feature allows administrators to add multiple users at once using .txt or .csv files. To ensure compatibility, download the sample CSV file, add your user details to this file, and upload the file.

**Key Considerations**

* Valid file types are _.txt_ or _.csv_. No other file types are allowed.
* The file must contain the required user information, such as name, email ID, and status, to create a user profile in your GALE account.
* Each row should contain information for ONE user.
* You can use accepted delimiters like Comma (","), Pipe ("|"), Semi-Colon (";"), and Tab in the file.
* The first row in the file should be the field name used to identify the user data.
* "*" indicates mandatory fields in the sample file. Please ensure mandatory fields are provided.
* The **User Status** indicates the user’s status after import, and the corresponding actions are taken for *New*, *Update*, and *Delete* statuses.
* Entries with invalid email formats, missing domain name, or wrong email IDs are ignored during import.
* Once an entry in the file is validated, an email request is sent out to the user to activate their account.
* If a user is already active (joined admin’s account), the email invitation is not sent.

2. Click the **Role** dropdown and select the required option in the bottom pane.
