# Role Management 

GALE’s **Role Management** feature in the **Settings** console helps implement Role-based Access Control (RBAC) for both account and agent features on the platform. 

Thus, the roles can be classified based on role types. [Learn more](./role-management.md/#role-types){:target="_blank"}.

When you [invite](../../getting-started/sign-up-sign-in.md/#invite-a-user-to-your-account){:target="_blank"}/add a user to your account, you must assign a [default role](./role-management.md/#system-defined-roles){:target="_blank"} to them to define their [module-wise permissions and access levels](./role-management.md/#module-wise-permissions-and-access-levels){:target="_blank"}. You can later [reassign a different role](./role-management.md/#reassign-an-alternative-role-to-active-users){:target="_blank"} to the user, including a [default/system-defined](./role-management.md/#system-defined-roles){:target="_blank"} or [custom](./role-management.md/#custom-roles){:target="_blank"} role. [Learn more](../user-management/overview.md){:target="_blank"} about **Users Management**.

**Key Points**

1. **Master Admin Role**

    * When you [create an account](../../getting-started/sign-up-sign-in.md/#steps-to-sign-up-and-activate-your-gale-account){:target="_blank"}, you automatically become the account owner and are assigned the **Master Admin** role. [Learn more](./role-management.md/#system-defined-roles){:target="_blank"}.

    * As the Master Admin, you have the highest level of access, allowing you to create, modify, and delete permissions for custom roles and manage users in your account.

2. **Assigning Roles**

    * Once a user joins your account, assign them a role based on their responsibilities and job functions. By default, the **Viewer** role is assigned to new users joining your account, providing the minimum level of account access required. [Learn more](./role-management.md/#system-defined-roles){:target="_blank"}. This role can be changed later in the **Settings** console. [Learn more](./role-management.md/#reassign-an-alternative-role-to-active-users){:target="_blank"}.

3. **Default and Custom Roles**

    * Each role comes with specific permissions and access levels to determine what features the user can access, modify, or manage. [Learn more](./role-management.md/#module-wise-permissions-and-access-levels){:target="_blank"}. 

    GALE supports the following roles in the **Settings** console:

    * **Default Role**: A system-generated role with internally defined set of permissions and access levels. [Learn more](./role-management.md/#system-defined-roles){:target="_blank"}.

    * **Custom Role**: Allows you to customize permissions and access levels for your users. [Learn more](./role-management.md/#custom-roles){:target="_blank"}.

4. **Role Management Benefits**

    * Enables better control over user actions in your account.
    * Facilitates updating roles when job functions or responsibilities change.
    * Ensures prompt revocation of access when a user leaves the organization or no longer requires access.

## Account and Agent Level Features

The features for which permissions and access levels are defined for a role include the following:

**Account Level**

* Agents
* Models
* Playground and Experiments
* Settings including Integrations, User Management, Security and Control, Monitoring, Guardrails, and Billing.

**Agent Level**

* Create an agent version
* Share/unshare agents/assign agent roles
* Delete agent
* Export Agent
* Monitor Trace of an Agent
* Edit Agent Workflow
* Manage Agent Configuration
* Manage deployment - deploy/undeploy
* Manage guardrails configuration
* Create/Delete an API key
* Monitor Audit logs

To learn more about permissions and access levels around features, click [here](./role-management.md/#module-wise-permissions-and-access-levels){:target="_blank"}.

Access to account or agent-level permissions can either be disabled (no access) or enabled with **Full**, **Custom**, or **View** privileges. [Learn more](./role-management.md/#access-levels){:target="_blank"}.

### Roles

A Role groups users according to their job functions, streamlining permission management. 

*Example*

A **Master Admin** has complete control over the account's core functionalities such as models, agents, integrations, users, etc.

An **Agent Admin** has complete control over the core functionalities of agents, such as deployment, configuration, sharing, deletion, monitoring, etc.

GALE supports the following roles:

#### System-defined Roles

Also called **Default** roles, these are inbuilt n the system at the account and agent levels defined in the system. The scopes, permissions, and access levels for these roles are preset based on what users commonly require and **cannot be modified** in the application. Also, system roles cannot be deleted.

To modify a user's scope and permissions, you must add a [custom](./role-management.md/#custom-roles){:target="_blank"} account/agent-type role. [Learn more](./role-management.md/#add-a-role){:target="_blank"}.

System-defined, system-generated, or default roles provide baseline control over the core features and functionalities and streamline the user management process for administrators. 

For example, The **Admin** role typically has full access to all agent/account features and functionalities within the system. Administrators have the highest privileges and can manage other users, configure settings, and perform administrative tasks.

The following table summarizes the scope for different system roles supported for Account and Agent type:

<table>
  <tr>
   <td colspan="2" ><strong>Account</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Role</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Description</strong>

  <tr>
   <td><strong>Master Admin</strong>

   <td>Users have complete control over agent and model management, user administration, integrations, security settings, and access to all core features and functionalities.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Admin</strong>

   <td>Users have access to all the permissions except model deletion, billing, and Kore connector.

   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Viewer</strong>
   </td>
   <td>Users can only view the modules across the platform.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

   <td><strong>Description</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Agent Admin</strong>
   </td>
   <td>Users have complete control over agent management, versioning, sharing, deployment, deletion, configuration, monitoring, and API key creation.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Agent Manager</strong>
   </td>
   <td>Users have access to all the permissions except for agent deletion.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Agent Editor</strong>
   </td>
   <td>Users can create new versions and deploy, monitor, and export agents.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Agent Viewer</strong>
   </td>
   <td>Users can only view the node details and generate output in the agent.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Custom Roles 

The admin can add these roles at the account/agent level. The scopes, permissions, and access levels can be custom-configured. Custom user roles allow for more fine-grained control over what actions different users can perform for at the account and agent levels.

Organizations can tailor access levels to their specific needs and organizational structure. This customization helps assign only the required permissions to specific users and improve security through role-based access. 

For example, a custom role, “_Banking Agent Conversation Moderator_,” can be customized for full access to agent guardrail configuration permission and no access to create and deploy an agent.

#### Key Considerations

* After creating a custom role, it will appear in the dropdown menu of the email invitation template. You can then select and assign this role to the user you invite to your account.
<img src="../images/custom-role-listing.png" alt="custom role listing" title="custom role listing" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

* You cannot delete a custom role if it is currently assigned to active users or included in an email invitation. The system displays an error message, as shown in the screenshot below.
<img src="../images/error-custom-role.png" alt="error custom role deletion" title="error custom role deletion" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:50%;">

To proceed, you must first unassign the role or assign an alternative role to these users, and then you can delete the custom role.

### Permissions

A **Permission** is a specific action or a set of actions the user can perform for the assigned role on either agent or account types. Examples include creating an agent, adding an external model, adding a user, and assigning a role.

### Access Levels

The Settings console supports two types of access: “_Yes_” indicates the user role has access to a module’s permission, and “_No_” means the user has no access. When the system/custom user role has access, the extent/level of access at the account or agent level is defined by the following presets: 

* **View**: The user can view the account and agent level but cannot edit or delete it.
* **Custom**: The user can view, add, and edit account and agent data but not delete it.
* **Full**: The user can view, add, edit, and delete account and agent data. 
* **No Access**: The user cannot access the feature.

[Learn more](./role-management.md/#module-wise-permissions-and-access-levels){:target="_blank"} about Module-wise permissions and access levels.

### Role Types 

A **Role Type** defines the module-wise scope and access level for the defined permissions and associated actions.

The following Role Types are defined on GALE:

* **Account**:  Users invited to the account must be assigned an Account role (default or custom). The role type manages access to features at the account level like models, agents, other users, integrations, and security permissions.
* **Agent**:  When a user is invited to an agent, they receive an Agent role. The role type manages access to features at the agent level like agent creation, deployment, versioning, deletion, monitoring, API integration, experimentation, export, etc.

A user can have an Account role within the account and one or more Agent roles within different agents. Agent roles are determined at the agent level, and you can assign these roles to users who are invited to your agent.

You can then modify, delete, or duplicate this custom role to create multiple copies and add module-wise permissions/access for each.

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p><ul><li>The changes you make to the duplicate role do not apply to the original system role.</li>
<li>The Last Updated On value is displayed for duplicate roles and shows the date and time when the duplicate was created.</li></ul></p>
</div>

<img src="../images/select-full-auto-select.png" alt="full auto select" title="full auto select" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

* Selecting **_Custom_** allows you to enable only the required module permissions.  <img src="../images/select-custom-access.png" alt="select custom access" title="select custom access" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

* Selecting **_View_** and **_No Access_** disables permissions selection.
<img src="../images/select-view-and-no-access.png" alt="select view and no access" title="select view and no access" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">       

* Selecting **_Full_** for **Settings** automatically sets the access levels of **Integrations** and **User Management** to **_Full_**.
<img src="../images/select-full-access.png" alt="select full access" title="select full access" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

Additionally, it automatically enables all the permissions for the following modules:

* Integrations (View is always enabled by default as it is the minimum required permission).
* User Management
* Security and Control Settings
* Manage Guardrail Models
* Billing
<img src="../images/full-select-for-all-permissions.png" alt="full access" title="full access" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">
* Selecting **_No Access_** for **Settings** automatically sets the access levels of **Integrations** to **_View_** and **User Management** to **_No Access_**.
<img src="../images/select-no-access.png" alt="no access" title="no access" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

Additionally, it disables all the permissions for the following modules:

  * Integrations (The **View** permission is always enabled by default).
  * User Management
  * Security and Control Settings
  * Manage Guardrail Models
  * Billing
  
  <img src="../images/disable-permissions.png" alt="disable permissions" title="disable permissions" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

Selecting **_Custom_** for **Settings** automatically sets the Integrations and User Management access levels to **_Custom_**.
<img src="../images/select-custom.png" alt="select custom" title="select custom" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

You can enable the required permissions for the following modules:

* Integrations
* User Management
* Security and Control Settings
* Manage Guardrail Models
* Billing

<img src="../images/enable-access-level.png" alt="enable access level" title="enable access level" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

You can change **_Custom_** to **_Full_** or **_View_** for **Integrations** and **_Full_** or **_No Access_** for **User Management**.
<img src="../images/change-access-level.png" alt="change access level" title="change access level" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

If you select **Role Type** as **_Agent_**, follow the steps below:

* Select **_Custom_**, **_View_**, or **_Full_** for **Access**. [Learn more](../user-management/role-management.md/#access-levels){:target="_blank"}. 

**_View_** is the default selection.
<img src="../images/access-options.png" alt="access options" title="access options" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">
                     
* Set up the agent permissions as follows in the **Enable/Disable agent access** section:
* If you select **_View_** for **Access**, permissions selection is automatically disabled.
<img src="../images/view-access.png" alt="view access" title="view access" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

* If you select **_Full_** for **Access**, all the permissions are automatically enabled.
<img src="../images/full-access.png" alt="full access" title="full access" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

* If you select **_Custom_** for **Access**, you can enable the required agent permissions and customize the role.                 
<img src="../images/custom-access.png" alt="custom access" title="custom access" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

4. Click **Create**.

The new custom role is created and listed on the **Role Management** dashboard.

<img src="../images/list-new-custom-role.png" alt="list new custom role" title="list new custom role" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

#### Edit a Custom Role

You can modify the role name, description, and access levels for account type or agent type roles’ permissions on the Settings console.

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p><ul><li>The system does not allow changing the <b>Role Type</b> once it is set. You must create a new custom role to assign a different role type.</li>
<li>When a custom role is updated, it changes the permissions for the assigned users.</li></ul></p>
</div>

To update a role, follow the steps below:

1. [Navigate](../user-management/role-management.md/#role-management-dashboard){:target="_blank"} to the **Role Management** dashboard on the **Settings** console.
2. Click the **Ellipses** icon for the custom role you want to modify.
3. Select **Edit**.
<img src="../images/edit-role.png" alt="edit role" title="edit role" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

4. Edit the required values for the following In the **Update Role** window:

    * Role Name
    * Role Description

Reset the access levels for module-wise Permissions in the **Enable/disable agent access** section based on the role’s requirements.

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The <b>Role Type</b> field is disabled for editing.</p>
</div> 

<img src="../images/role-type-field-disabled.png" alt="role type disabled" title="role type disabled" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

<ol start="5"><li>Click <b>Update</b>.</li>
<img src="../images/update-role-window.png" alt="update role window" title="update role window" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;"></ol>

A success message is displayed upon completing the role edit, and the updated role details appear on the dashboard.

<img src="../images/role-updated-message.png" alt="role updated message" title="role updated message" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

#### Delete a Custom Role

You can delete a custom role if you want to permanently remove it from the system and unassign it from users.

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>You can only delete one role at a time. Bulk delete is not supported.</p>
</div> 

**Prerequisite**

Before you delete a role, ensure that the custom role is not assigned to any active users. If the role is assigned, do one of the following:

* Reassign an alternative role to the active users. [Learn more](../user-management/role-management.md/#reassign-an-alternative-role-to-active-users){:target="_blank"}.

* Remove Inactive users to whom this role is assigned.

To delete a role, follow the steps below:

1. [Navigate](../user-management/role-management.md/#role-management-dashboard){:target="_blank"} to the **Role Management** dashboard on the **Settings** console.
2. Click the **Ellipses** icon for the custom role you want to delete.
3. Select **Delete**.
<img src="../images/select-delete-role.png" alt="select delete role" title="select delete role" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

4. Click **Confirm** in the **Delete Role** confirmation window.
<img src="../images/delete-role-confirm.png" alt="confirm delete role" title="confirm delete role" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

A success message is displayed, and the role is deleted from the **Role Management** dashboard.

#### Role Deletion Error and Workaround 

The **Settings** console allows you to delete only unassigned roles. If a role is assigned to active/inactive users during deletion, the following error message is displayed.
<img src="../images/role-deletion-error.png" alt="role deletion error" title="role deletion error" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

You must perform one of the following workarounds.

##### Reassign an Alternative Role to Active Users

1. [Navigate](../user-management/role-management.md/#role-management-dashboard){:target="_blank"} to **Users Management** > **Users** on the **Settings** Console.
2. Click the **Account Role** entry for the user.
3. Select the role you want to reassign.
<img src="../images/select-role-to-reassign.png" alt="reassign role" title="reassign role" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

Once you reassign the role for the user, go to the **Role Management** dashboard and delete the role using the steps mentioned [here](../user-management/role-management.md/#delete-a-custom-role){:target="_blank"}.

The role is deleted successfully from the **Role Management** dashboard and the count for custom roles is updated (decreased).
<img src="../images/custom-role-deleted.png" alt="custom role deleted" title="custom role deleted" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

##### Delete Assigned Users

[Navigate](../user-management/role-management.md/#role-management-dashboard){:target="_blank"} to the **Users Management** dashboard and follow the steps mentioned in the **Delete Users** section to delete all the assigned users individually or in bulk. Once the user is deleted, go to the **Role Management** dashboard and [delete](../user-management/role-management.md/#delete-a-custom-role){:target="_blank"} the required custom role.

Deleting the assigned users removes their association with the role you want to delete.

#### Duplicate a Custom Role

Like a system role, you can duplicate a custom role, which copies the name, role type, and configurations for permissions and access. Follow the steps mentioned [here](../user-management/role-management.md/#duplicate-system-role){:target="_blank"} to complete the process for a custom role.
<img src="../images/duplicate-custom-role.png" alt="duplicate custom role" title="duplicate custom role" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">
