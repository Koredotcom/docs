# About Agents

Agents can automate processes, streamline workflows, generate insights, and create outputs like deal summaries or emails. GALE's agent builder empowers you to create AI-powered workflows and automations using a visual drag-and-drop interface with little to no coding required. You can easily configure settings, combine multiple workflows, and integrate with systems like AWS.

### Key Features

* **Agent Flow**: A visual no-code/low-code builder for creating and managing agent flows and versions. It uses nodes and transitions to help you automate end-to-end tasks without writing complex code. [Learn more](./create-a-new-agent.md).

* **Sharing & Permissions**: Account owners can invite users to collaborate on specific Agents. Invited users can access the Models and Data modules for the invited account and see only the Agents they are invited to. [Learn more](./manage-user-roles-and-permissions.md).

* **Agent Endpoint**: After building and testing your agent flow, you can deploy it. Once deployed, you'll receive an API endpoint for your agent, which you can use to integrate it with other systems. [Learn more](./deploy-an-agent.md).

* **API Keys**: Create API keys for your deployed agents to access them from external systems securely. Share these keys only with trusted users. [Learn more](./create-a-new-api-key.md).

* **Guardrails**: Deploy various guardrail models and use them to scan LLM requests and responses to enforce safety and appropriateness standards. [Learn more](./guardrails/add-a-scanner.md).

* **Configurations**: Manage your agent's general details, define reusable values and configurations using environment variables, and undeploy the agent. [Learn more](./configure-an-agent.md).
