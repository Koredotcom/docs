# Accessing GALE

By signing up and creating an account, you can efficiently manage GALE's modules and collaborate with your team on projects in one place.

## Supported Browsers

Use the latest version of Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari, or Firefox. Internet Explorer mode in Microsoft Edge is not supported.

## GALE Account Creation Using SSO

You can sign up for GALE at [https://gale.kore.ai/](https://gale.kore.ai/){:target="_blank"}.

When you sign up for GALE using Single Sign-On (SSO) options such as Google or Office 365, the platform utilizes your email address to create an account. Here's how the process works based on the domain of your email address:

**Email Address with Kore.com Domain**

* If your email address ends with "@kore.com" (e.g., <john@kore.com>), you are automatically granted access to GALE.
* You can directly create an account with your Kore.com email without any additional steps.

**Email Address with a Different Domain**

* If your email address has a different domain (e.g., <john@doe.com>), you cannot directly create an account.
* The Kore team needs to invite you to join GALE.
* Once invited, you can then proceed to create an account using your email address.

This ensures that only users with a Kore.com email can self-register, while others need authorization from the Kore team to gain access.

## Accounts

While you sign up for GALE, you must do the following:

**Create an Account**

* Use your email address to register.
* Set a password for your new account.

**Name Your Account**

* After creating the account, provide a name that will be displayed on your user interface (UI). [Learn more](./sign-up-sign-in.md/#create-an-account){:target="_blank"}.

**Master Admin Role**

When you create the first user account on GALE, you automatically become the **Master Admin** or **Owner**. [Learn more](./sign-up-sign-in.md/#create-an-account){:target="_blank"}.

This role provides access to default permissions and administrative capabilities:

* **Invite Team Members**: Invite others to join your account via the **Settings** page to collaborate on agents, models, experiments, and other modules.
* **Administrative Tasks**: Manage account users, including adding, deleting, and modifying user profiles, and assigning roles and permissions. [Learn more](../settings/settings-overview.md){:target="_blank"}.

**Joining and Switching Accounts**

* **Invitations**: You can be invited to join other accounts by their respective owners.
* **Switching Accounts**: If you are part of multiple accounts, you can switch between them to work on various projects.

On the **Settings** page, you must enable the **invite users** permission to allow a user in your account to invite other users to their account.

**Enable Invite Users**

You can assign a system or custom role to a user in your account. This user can invite others only if the assigned role supports the **invite user's** permission. You can check this permission with the steps below:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Users Management** > **Role Management**.
2. Click **View** for the role you have assigned to the user.
<img src="../images/click-view-role-option.png" alt="click view role" title="click view role" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

3. In the resulting window, go to **Settings** > **User Management** and select **Invite User**.
<img src="../images/enable-invite-users.png" alt="enable invite users" title="enable invite users" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>For a custom role, you can enable <b>Invite User</b>. For a system role, editing this permission is not allowed.</p>
</div>

### Account Owner Privileges

An account owner or master admin can perform the following functions:

* Access the **Settings** page. [Learn more](../settings/settings-overview.md){:target="_blank"}.
* Add users via email invite or file import to their account.
* Delete users from their account (possible only when the user has deleted all the agents they’ve created).
* Manage data for user profiles, sessions/devices, agents, and models in their accounts.
* View system role details.
* Create, delete, and update custom roles.
* Assign or change roles (system/custom) for one or more users.
* Enable/disable Account or Agent permissions and set access levels for custom roles.
* Configure Active Directory synchronization of user data from another organization. Set up periodic and automatic refresh, and view sync history to track updates.
* Configure the ability to view and edit user profile fields.
* Set up which users will receive email notifications when they are added to the admin’s account.
* Manage guardrail scanners and configured integrations for the account.

## New Account Sign Up and Activation

If you do not have an account on GALE, visit this home page [link](https://gale.kore.ai/){:target="_blank"} to sign up and follow the steps mentioned [here](./sign-up-sign-in.md/#steps-to-sign-up-and-activate-your-gale-account){:target="_blank"}.

You can sign up on GALE in one of the following ways:

* **Create a new account**: GALE allows signing up using a valid email address. You can sign up to create a personal account or even set up your enterprise account in Kore AIi. After you sign up for the account, you automatically become the account’s admin, which allows you to invite other users to the account.
* **Join an existing enterprise account**: If your enterprise is already on Kore.ai, you can join the account in one of the following ways:
  * Your enterprise account’s Admin sends you an invite. If you haven’t already received the invitation email, reach out to them for access.
  * You can sign up using your enterprise email account. You will then be prompted to either join the enterprise network or create a personal account.

### Steps to Sign Up and Activate Your GALE Account

1. On the login page, click **Sign Up**.
<img src="../images/sign-up-page.png" alt="sign up page" title="sign up page" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

2. Choose an SSO profile to sign in to your account and access GALE.
<img src="../images/choose-sso-profile.png" alt="choose sso profile" title="choose sso profile" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

Alternatively, enter your email address and click **Continue** to sign up via email.

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>You can sign in by entering the password if the email address is registered.</p>
</div>

<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>GALE is accessible by invitation only. If your email domain is different from Kore.ai, the system prompts you to request the Kore.ai admin for access.</p>
</div>

<img src="../images/gale-accessible-by-invitation-only.png" alt="invitation only" title="invitation only" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

Once the admin accepts your request via an invitation, you can complete the sign-up process.

<ol start="3"><li>To sign up via email, enter your <b>Full Name</b> and <b>Password</b>, and click <b>Create Account</b>.</li></ol>

<p>Ensure you set a strong password that includes the following:</p>
<ul><li>A minimum of 12 characters.</li>
<img src="../images/password-12-characters-long.png" alt="12 characters" title="12 characters" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;"></ul>
<ul><li>At least one special character.</li>
<img src="../images/password-special-character.png" alt="special character" title="special character" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;"></ul>
<ul><li>At least one number.</li>
<img src="../images/password-number-character.png" alt="number required" title="number required" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;"></ul>
<ul><li>At least one lower case character.</li>
<img src="../images/password-lowercase-character.png" alt="lower case" title="lower case" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;"></ul>
<ul><li>At least one upper case character.</li>
<img src="../images/password-uppercase-character.png" alt="strong password" title="strong password" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;"></ul>

<p>If the password is strong (ideal), the following message is displayed, and the <b>Create Account</b> button is enabled.</p>
<img src="../images/strong-password-set.png" alt="strong password" title="strong password" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

### **Account Activation**

After you initiate the sign-up process, GALE sends an email to the address you provided. This email contains a verification link and a code to activate your account.

Look for the verification email from GALE in your inbox. If you don’t see it, check your spam or junk folder.

Do one of the following to validate your account:

1. Click the **Verify Email** button or click/copy and paste the verification URL into the browser. Upon verification, your account is created.
<img src="../images/verify-email.png" alt="verify email" title="verify email" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

2. Enter the 6-digit verification code included in your email on the verification page.
<img src="../images/verification-code.png" alt="verification code" title="verification code" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

Entering a valid code completes the verification and signs you in automatically.

**Expired or Invalid Links and Codes**

Expired or invalid links don’t allow you to complete the account verification process as follows:

**Expiration and Invalidity**

Verification links and codes have an expiration time set at the application level. The system notifies you if you attempt to use an expired or invalid link or code.

**Requesting a New Link/Code**

If the verification link or code expires or becomes invalid, the system prompts you to request a new one. Follow the instructions to complete the verification process.

## Sign in to GALE

Once you sign up and activate your GALE account, you can sign in for the first time on the [login page](https://qa-gale.kore.ai/){:target="_blank"} using one of the following methods:

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
Please complete the email OTP verification to sign in successfully.</div>

1. Click your Google, MS Office 365, or LinkedIn profile (account), and provide your credentials registered on the service for Single Sign-on (SSO) and authentication.

    <img src="../images/login-with-SSO.png" alt="login with sso" title="login with sso" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

2. Enter your registered email ID and click **Continue with Email**.

<img src="../images/continue-with-email.png" alt="continue with email" title="continue with email" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

Then, enter your password and click **Login**.

<img src="../images/click-login.png" alt="click login" title="click login" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>Once you create an account, you need to add credits for computation hours to start using GALE's features.</p>
</div>

### Failed Login and Account Locking

If you enter the wrong password when using email sign-in, the system displays an **Invalid Credential** message, preventing you from signing in to your account (of which you are the admin).

<img src="../images/invalid-credentials.png" alt="invalid credentials" title="invalid credentials" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

You are allowed up to 5 attempts to retry the correct password and log in.

<img src="../images/five-attempts.png" alt="five login attempts" title="five login attempts" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

Exceeding the fifth failed login attempt locks your account for 30 minutes, after which the account is unlocked automatically, and you can retry signing in.

<img src="../images/account-locked.png" alt="account locked" title="account locked" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

An alternative way is to request the <b>master admin</b> to unlock your account.

When your account is locked, the status for you shows as "<b><i>Locked</i></b>" to all the admins who have added you to their account. This status update ensures that admins are aware of your restricted access and can unlock your account.

If you are the admin and want to unlock a user linked to your account, follow the instructions given [here](../settings/user-management/users.md/#unlock-a-locked-user){:target="_blank"}.

When your account is locked, you can attempt to log in using an alternative method by clicking **Login using another account**. This action redirects you to a page where you can sign in via your default SSO service, such as Google, Windows, or LinkedIn.

### Reset Password

You can reset your password in the following scenarios:

* If you do not remember the correct password to log in to GALE.
* You want to change the password at regular intervals due to security reasons.

To reset, follow the steps below:

1. Click the **Forgot Password?** Link.
<img src="../images/forgot-password-link.png" alt="forgot password" title="forgot password" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

2. Enter your email address on the **Forgot Password** page and click **Send reset link**.
<img src="../images/send-reset-link.png" alt="send reset link" title="send reset link" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

You will receive instructions via email on how to reset your password. Check your Spam folder to see if the email does not appear in your inbox. Click **Resend email** if you have not received it.

<img src="../images/resend-email.png" alt="resend email" title="resend email" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

<ol start="3"><li>Click the <b>Reset Password</b> link in the email, or copy and paste the URL into your browser.
<img src="../images/click-password-link-in-email.png" alt="click reset link" title="click reset link" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;"></li>
<li>Enter the new password in the <b>New Password</b> and <b>Confirm Password</b> fields.
<img src="../images/enter-new-passsword.png" alt="enter new password" title="enter new password" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;"></li></ol>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
If both the entries do not match, you cannot proceed.</div>

<ol start="5"><li>Click <b>Reset Password</b>.</li>
<img src="../images/reset-password.png" alt="reset password" title="reset password" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;"></ol>

The password is reset successfully. On the [Sign In](./sign-up-sign-in.md/#sign-in-to-gale){:target="_blank"} page, enter the new password for your email account.

#### Change Expired Password

When your password expires after 90 days, the system redirects to the following page where you can change the expired password.

<img src="../images/change-password-screen.png" alt="change password" title="change password" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

To change the password, enter the expired password in the **Old Password** textbox and follow Steps 4 and 5 in the previous section. Please ensure the password values in the **New password** and **Confirm password** fields match to enable the <b>Reset Password</b> button.

<img src="../images/old-new-password-match.png" alt="passwords match" title="passwords match" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

A mismatch in the **New password** and **Confirm password** fields displays an <b>Alert</b> icon against the mismatched field, while disabling the <b>Reset Password</b> button, as shown below:

<img src="../images/old-new-password-mismatch.png" alt="passwords mismatch" title="passwords mismatch" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

## GALE Landing Page

After signing in, you are redirected based on the number of accounts you have joined. If you have one account, the system will redirect you to the **Agents** section of that account’s UI. If no agents are added to your account, the following page is displayed.

<img src="../images/gale-landing-page.png" alt="gale landing page" title="gale landing page" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

**Choose from Multiple Accounts**

If you are a part of multiple accounts, you must choose the account you want to use in the window shown below:

<p>Please note the following when adding an email address:</p>
<ul><li>The system does not accept a space in front, between, or after the mail ID.</li>
<li>You cannot add just a word; a domain should be attached to it.</li>
<li>An empty value is not accepted.</li>
<li>You must correct every entered email before sending the invite, else the <b>invite</b> button is disabled.</li>
<li>If there is an error then the email with the issue is highlighted.</li></ul>
</div>

<ol start="5">
<li>Select an account-level system role from the dropdown list with the following options:</li>
<ul><li><b>Viewer (default)</b>: Users can only view the modules across the platform. This is the default selection. You can select another option from the dropdown list before sending the invite or change the role on the dashboard once the user is added.</li>

<p><ul><li>An email invite to join your account is valid for 15 days. You must resend the invite to the user once it expires, as discussed in the next section.</li>
<li>Until the recipient accepts your invitation to join, the user status is set to <b><i>Inactive</i></b>. Once the invitation is accepted, the status changes to <b><i>Active</i></b>.</li></ul></p>
</div>

## Resend Email Invitation

An email invitation link remains valid for **15 days** from the date it is sent. After this period, the link expires, and the user will no longer be able to join your account using it. In this case, you'll need to send a new email invitation with a fresh link.

On the **Users** dashboard of the **Settings** Console, an **Alert** icon appears in the **Status** column for the recipient, if their invitation link has expired. Hovering over the icon displays the message "_Invitation link has expired_."

<img src="../images/invitation-link-expired.png" alt="invitation link expired" title="invitation link expired" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

To resend the invitation, click the **Resend invite** button.

<img src="../images/resend-invite.png" alt="resend invite" title="resend invite" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

This action automatically sends an invitation email with a new link to the user, causing the **Alert** icon and the **Resend invite** button to disappear for the user. The status remains set as **_Inactive_** until the user joins the account when it changes to **_Active_**.

A success message appears to indicate that your invitation has been sent.

<img src="../images/success-message-invitaton.png" alt="success message invitation sent" title="success message invitation sent" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

The recipient receives the following invitation email.

<img src="../images/recipient-email-invitation.png" alt="recipient email invitation" title="recipient email invitation" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

Once the end user clicks the **Open Invite** button, the system redirects to the sign-in page. After signing in, the user can access your account, in addition to their account.

## Make an Account your Default
