## Publish a Pre-Built Agent

Administrators can publish selected pre-built agents to make them available to users through the Agent Store.

**Steps to Publish a Pre-Built Agent**

1. Navigate to **User Profile** > **Admin Console** > **Workspaces** > **API Agents** or **Prompt Agents**. Find see a list of Pre-Built Agents, each marked with a "Prebuilt" label.
2. Toggle the switch **ON** next to the specific agent, or click the **ellipsis (⋮)** icon. A pop-up window appears.
3. Provide the following details: 
**Published Version**: Select the version of the agent you want to publish. 
**Publish to**: Choose who has the access to the agent:
    * **Admins**: Restricts the agent to Admin users only.
    * **Selected User Groups/Users**: Allows you to specify individual users or groups.
    * **Everyone in the Account**: Makes the agent available to all users.
4. **Actions**: Choose what users can do with this agent:
    * **Lookup**: Users can search for existing items.
    * **Creation**: Users can create new items.
5. For example, for a Jira agent, you can allow users to look up issues or also let them create new issues.
6. Click **Publish**. The system displays the **Auth Settings** screen before completing the publishing process. See the section below for details.


## Configure Authentication Settings

When you click **Publish** for a pre-built agent, the platform presents the Auth Settings screen. You must configure authentication before the agent is available to users.

**Authorization Method**

The Auth Settings screen displays the type of authorization that the agent supports. This field is read-only and shows one of the following methods:


* **OAuth**: Most pre-built agents use this method (Jira, HubSpot, Microsoft 365 Calendar, Microsoft 365 Email, Microsoft OneDrive, Microsoft Teams, Google Calendar, Google Mail, Google Drive, Slack).
* **Basic Auth**: The Zendesk agent uses this method.


### OAuth Application Configuration

For agents that use OAuth, the Auth Settings screen presents two options:

**Use Product Registered OAuth Application**: Select this option to route the OAuth credentials of the user's account to the product-registered application. The platform stores and manages the credentials automatically.

**Use Your Own OAuth Application**: Select this option to use your organization's own OAuth application credentials. When you select this option, the following fields appear:



* **Client ID** (editable): Enter the Client ID from your OAuth application.
* **Client Secret** (editable): Enter the Client Secret from your OAuth application.
* **Redirect URL** (read-only): Displays the redirect URL that you must register in your OAuth application. Use the copy icon to copy this value.
* **Scopes** (read-only): Displays the required OAuth scopes. Use the copy icon to copy these values.

The **Save** button enables after you enter valid values for Client ID and Client Secret.

**Google Agents Restriction**

For Google agents (Google Calendar, Google Mail, and Google Drive), the platform displays only the **Your Own OAuth Application** option. You must provide your own OAuth application credentials to use these agents.

**Zendesk Authentication**

The Zendesk agent uses **Basic Auth** instead of OAuth. When you publish the Zendesk agent, the Auth Settings screen prompts you to enter Basic Auth credentials (username and password or API token) rather than OAuth details.


### Setting Up Your Own OAuth Application

Each third-party system requires you to register an OAuth application before you can use the "Your Own OAuth Application" option. The Auth Settings screen includes a **Find More Details** link for each system. Use the following resources to set up your OAuth application:


* **Jira**: Refer to the [Atlassian guide](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/oauth/getting-started/enabling-oauth-3lo/) on enabling OAuth 2.0 (3LO) in the Atlassian Developer portal. 
Required scopes: `offline_access`, `read:jira-user`, `read:jira-work`, `write:jira-work`, `manage:jira-project`, `manage:jira-configuration`, `manage:jira-data-provider`, `manage:jira-webhook`, `read:me`

After you configure and save the authentication settings, the platform redirects you to the **Publishing** screen to complete the agent publishing process.

**Access Auth Settings After Publishing**

You can access the Auth Settings at any time after publishing through two entry points:

**OAuth Settings Banner**: The Publishing screen displays an OAuth Settings banner. Click the banner to navigate back to the Auth Settings screen.

**Three-Dot Menu**: Click the ellipsis (⋮) menu on the Publishing screen and select **Auth Settings** to open the Auth Settings screen.


## Using a Published Agent

After the administrator publishes an agent and configures authentication, users can access it through the Agent Store. Users open the Agent Store, click **Connect** for the desired agent, and follow the on-screen instructions to **Add Connection**. After the user successfully adds the connection, the agent responds to user questions and queries through the Ask or Search Anything box on the homepage.
