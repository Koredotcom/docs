Embedding models generate vector representations of text, enabling semantic search, similarity matching, and other advanced AI features. Platform supports both pre-built and custom embedding models to power these capabilities.

**What are Embeddings?**

Embeddings are numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning. Unlike traditional keyword matching, embeddings allow AI systems to understand context, intent, and relationships between concepts. This enables more intelligent search results, better content recommendations, and improved natural language understanding.

!!!note
     Embedding models are required for the attachments functionality, where end users can attach files and ask questions about them.
