# Mock Scenes

Mock Scenes are a feature through which you can simulate a conversation between a user and your Virtual Assistant, using the Conversation Designer.

Conversations that are designed using Mock Scenes can then be implemented into Dialog Tasks, which the VA can work with when interacting with users.

In this article, you will learn how to work with this feature in order to prototype a conversation.


## Benefits

Mock Scenes are specifically created for conversation designers to prototype bot-user interactions before the conversation moves to the development stage. The Conversation Designer in use within this feature is specifically adapted to allow designers to focus on the conversation flow itself, without worrying about the systems and logic building side of the Virtual Assistant.


## Major Features

* Create a conversation exchange prototype, between the assistant and the user, based on natural language, that can follow different paths, depending on the responses that each participant provides..
* Collaborate during the prototyping process, using notes and comments.
* Map important points in the conversation, using a timeline based on predefined hashtags or custom tags.
* Link to existing messages or to other scenes.
* Preview the conversation prototype in a customizable, shareable ad collaborative view,


## Mock Scene Options

The Mock Scenes area allows you to perform the following actions:

* **Import** an existing scene in a CSV format.
* **Sort** scenes based on any column.
* **Search** for a scene by name.
* When hovering over each scene, you have an option to:
    * **Share** the scene with other users or teams.
    * **Clone** the scene to create a copy.
    * **Export** the scene into CSV format.
    * **Delete** the scene.

## Create a Mock Scene

To create a Mock Scene, please follow the steps below:

1. On the **App Settings** page, select **Dev Tools > Mock Scenes** tab and click **Create Scene**.
2. On the _New Scene_ dialog box that opens up, enter a name in the **Scene Name** field and a description in the **Description** field.
3. Enter a **Status**.
4. Click **Proceed**.

The demo below shows you the basics of creating a new Mock Scene.

## Work with the Conversation Designer

After you add a scene, you are presented with a blank **Conversation View**, where you can enter the user-VA messages. Mock Scenes provide options that are specifically focused on developing the conversation itself, without the business logic or training. This helps create a more seamless user experience and provides VA developers with a starting point for their work. 

<img src="../images/mock-scenes-img3-blank-scene.png" alt="Conversation view - Blank scene" title="Conversation view - Blank scene" style="border:1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">

To design a mock conversation scene, you can add _Bot_ and _User_ utterances, create conversation paths, link messages and scenes, add developer notes and collaborate using comments. You can also create a conversation timeline, using tags. 

The Conversation Designer comes with the following features to help you design the conversation:


### User and Bot Message Tabs

#### User Tab

This tab is used to enter possible messages from users either requesting information or providing input to a request by the virtual assistant. These messages can be:

* **Plain text messages**. For example, in a Travel VA, _I want to know when check in opens for my flight._
* **Attachments**. For example, in a Travel VA, to upload a flight reservation..


#### Bot Tab

This tab is used to design messages that the Virtual Assistant sends to users as a greeting, information, answer to a user query, or request for input. These messages can be:

* **Plain text messages** with options to mark text as bold, italic, indent, multi-line, and lists – ordered and unordered.
* **Rich messages** using predefined templates such as buttons, list, quick reply, etc,. ([see below](#bot-messages-and-templates) for a list of supported templates).

    <img src="../images/mock-scenes-img4-bot-message-templates.png" alt="Bot message templates" title="Bot message templates" style="border:1px solid gray; zoom:50%;">

* **Notes**: These are used to add text between messages describing an action or a section of the conversation.

    <img src="../images/mock-scenes-img5-scene-notes.png" alt="Scene Notes" title="Scene Notes" style="border:1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">

* Notes also provide an option to define the timeline of the conversation by using _hashtags_. Thus, defined notes help denote an important state in the conversation that is displayed on the left of the conversation under the **Story Timeline**. You can move to the relevant place in the conversation by clicking the tag on the timeline.You can define your own _custom tags_ or use one of the _predefined tags_. Each of these predefined tags is depicted by a unique symbol in the timeline indicating its purpose. These predefined tags include:
    * \#Start_< intent-name >
    * \#Hold_< intent-name >
    * \#End_< intent-name >
    * \#Resume_< intent-name >.

* With the _tag_ option, you can **classify notes** using an existing tag or by creating a new custom tag. These tags are color-coded for reference.

    <img src="../images/mock-scenes-img6-create-custom-tag.png" alt="Create Custom tag" title="Create Custom tag" style="border:1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">


* **Paths**: Paths are different flows that the conversations might follow, based on the options provided by the VA or the user. For example, a Virtual Assistant expects a _yes_ or _no_ response from the user, and the path differs based upon the user response. Using the bot message, the template defines the number of alternate paths allowed. The business logic can also decide the number of paths.
    * To continue the scene along a specific path, you can select the path either using the **Previous Path** (**&lt;-**) and **Next Path** (**->**) or select the options given to the user. You can also add additional paths using the **New Path** (**+**) option.

        <img src="../images/mock-scenes-img7-scene-conv-path.png" alt="Select Path" title="Select Path" style="border:1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">


### Message Options

When you hover over a message you can find the following options:

* Add **New Path,**
* Add **Comments,**
* **Delete** a message,
* **Link a Message**: You can use this option to link another message in this scene and continue a flow that is already designed. When selected, this option transitions to the Flow view from where you can select the message node, and link it to the current node.

    !!! Note
    
        This option is available only for the leaf nodes with no flow defined.

* **Link a Scene**: You can use this option to link a predefined scene in the Storyboard. This scene is invoked during the preview. When selected, this option gives a list of scenes for you to select from and link it to the current node. You can also perform the following  actions:
    * View Scene: Click **View Scene** to open in a read-only window.
    * Unlink: Click **Unlink** to unlink the scene.
* **Edit**: Allows you to edit the message.

### Comments

Comments are a very useful collaborative tool. The Storyboard Scenes area allows users to add comments to any component of the scene, such as user messages, VA messages, and notes. You can also reply to an existing comment thus maintaining a comments thread.

To add a comment, click the **message options** icon, then select **Comment**. 

<img src="../images/mock-scenes-img9-scene-add-comment.png" alt="Add Comment" title="Add Comment" style="border:1px solid gray; zoom:50%;">

When a message has a comment attached, you will see a comment icon next to it, as shown below.

<img src="../images/mock-scenes-img10-scene-marked-comment-on-message.png" alt="Marked comment on message" title="Marked comment on message" style="border:1px solid gray; zoom:50%;">

You can access the full comment history using the comments icon at the scene level. This section provides the following options:

* **Search** through existing comments.
* **View** existing comments.
* **Star** a comment and **filter by starred** comments.
* **Delete** any comments you have made.
* **Reply** to comments.

### Scene Options

From the Scene page, you can perform the following actions:

<img src="../images/mock-scenes-img12-scene-options.png" alt="Scene Options" title="Scene Options" style="border:1px solid gray; zoom:50%;">

* **Preview**: It is used to see how the conversation flows on your website. This opens in a mock website with the chat window. You can **Play/Pause, Restart, Customize,** and **Exit** the preview.

<img src="../images/mock-scenes-img13-scene-preview-1.png" alt="Scene Preview" title="Scene Preview" style="border:1px solid gray; zoom:50%;">

* **Share**: This option gives you a URL that you can share with others. This URL presents the scene preview, so you can provide the various stakeholders with a glimpse of what to expect and take their feedback. You can secure the scene preview URL with a password.

<img src="../images/mock-scenes-img14-share-scene.png" alt="Share scene" title="Share scene" style="border:1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">

The shared link allows the viewer to add comments that are communicated back to the developer for further action.
