# Realtime Multimodal - AI Agents and Models Orchestration

Realtime multimodal orchestration dynamically coordinates AI agents and models. It processes and responds to various data types, such as text, audio, images, and video, in realtime. This allows for smooth, context-aware interactions and automated tasks. It integrates different modalities and manages complex workflows among AI components.

Traditional AI systems can handle only one input type. However, Multimodal orchestration enables AI systems to simultaneously understand, interpret, and generate responses from diverse data streams. This is essential for applications like conversational AI agents, customer service AI chatbots, and digital assistants that engage users across different channels and formats.


## Key Capabilities

* **Richer Context and Understanding**: By integrating multiple data types, the system achieves a deeper and more accurate understanding of user needs and environments.

* **Improved Accuracy and User Experience**: Cross-referencing modalities and maintaining conversation history leads to more accurate, contextually relevant responses and a seamless user experience.

* **Scalability and Flexibility**: Orchestration frameworks can scale across many agents and servers, supporting thousands of concurrent interactions without requiring code changes.

* **Processes Virtually Any Input**: Multimodal AI can handle text, images, audio, and other input types, and convert those prompts into any output format.

## Core Architecture and Functionality

The core architecture of a Realtime Multimodal Orchestration system typically includes the following components and workflow:

1. **Input Layer**: The system captures data from various sources, including spoken queries (audio), written text, and uploaded images. A session manager handles WebSocket connections and detects the input modality.

2. **Native Multimodal Model**: Modern, realtime multimodal models (such as OpenAI GPT-4o Realtime, Google Gemini Live, or Azure OpenAI Realtime API) process audio and text natively without requiring separate ASR-to-LLM-to-TTS pipelines. These models understand and generate across modalities directly, preserving vocal nuances and enabling lower latency.

3. **Orchestration Layer**: The App Orchestrator plans, reasons, and delegates tasks to the appropriate AI agents based on the current context and user intent. It manages multi-agent coordination and maintains session context.

4. **Task Execution and Coordination**: Each agent may have its own task execution procedure, tools, and sub-agents. The orchestrator ensures tasks are executed in the correct sequence and handles dynamic user interactions. Function calling can occur mid-stream without breaking the conversation flow.

5. **Output Layer**: The system provides immediate streaming responses and adapts to new inputs or changes in context. Guardrails validate outputs and ensure reliability in real-time operations.
