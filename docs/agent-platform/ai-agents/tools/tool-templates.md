# Tool Templates

Instead of building a tool flow from scratch, **Tool Templates** enable you to access pre-configured tool flows that are pre-configured tool flows that are designed and tailored to your business use case from the Tools library/marketplace. These pre-built integrations across various domains provide a fast, no-code way to automate repetitive tasks and streamline operations, requiring minimal setup.

You can customize the tool’s actions (how the tool responds) and enhance the automation flow. Simply select a template and import it into the Tools dashboard with zero coding efforts. The template types you can leverage include:

* **Pre-built templates**: These ready-to-deploy templates come with use-case scenarios and pre-configured integrations, like an email auto-replier or an automated grading system.
* **Customizable templates**: The various node types in the tool flow on the Platform allow you to tailor the tool flow to your business needs.

Tool templates are the foundation for building AI tools. They provide a structure for workflows, ensuring a smooth user experience. They're a reliable and efficient starting point for automating tasks like lead capture, order scheduling, and customer support.  

**Key Benefits**

* **Quick Set Up**

    Pre-built and customizable tool flows enable effortless AI tool deployment, significantly reducing time and costs while ensuring efficiency and adaptability to specific needs.

* **Customizable**

    You can customize tool flows on the canvas by retaining essential prebuilt elements and removing unnecessary ones from the tool template while leveraging proven automation patterns.

* **Seamless Integration**

    Within minutes, your tool template can seamlessly integrate into existing tool flows and automate key actions, such as directly adding prospective leads to your CRM. 

* **Enhanced Developer Experience**

    These prebuilt templates eliminate repetitive tasks, ensuring smooth, uninterrupted automation while letting you build unique tool flows with minimal effort and no coding.

**Important Considerations**

* A *PDF* document with the key details listed below is displayed. You can download and save this page for future reference.
    * Input to the Agent
    * Output from the Agent
    * Configuring Environment Variables
    * How to Use the Agent
    * Key components
    * Additional configuration guidelines
      <img src="../images/tools-pdf.png" alt="tools pdf" title="tools pdf" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

* **Naming Convention**
    
    * The first installation of a template retains its original name and description.
    <img src="../images/first-tool-installation.png" alt="first tool installation" title="first tool installation" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

    * When you reinstall the same template, the system notifies you of a duplicate and appends a unique number to the name to prevent conflicts in the format: <code><em>Tool Template Name + "_" + System-Generated Sequential Number</em></code>
    * Example: <em>Automatic grading system_1743151769005</em>
