# Export a Tool

Agent Platform offers the ability to export specific tool versions from your account as self-contained packages for data preservation and sharing. This feature also allows users to transfer tool configurations without compromising the integrity and security of the tool setup.

When you export a tool, Platform automatically creates a *.zip* file named after the tool. For example, if the tool is named "*Banking Assistant*," the exported file will be "*Banking Assistant.zip*". You can save this folder in the desired location on your local machine. 

The exported package can be reimported to create a new tool or add it as a version to an existing one, ensuring seamless restoration.

The [exported package](#exported-information){:target="_blank"} preserves the following tool configurations within JSON files:

* Name and description
* API, Condition, AI, and Script node configurations
* Input/output variables and scanners
* Environment variables
* Sync/Async setup

To maintain security, sensitive information such as **API keys**, **sharing permissions**, **tool endpoint**, and **audit logs** are excluded from the exported package.

## Exported Information

The exported package includes the following JSON files encapsulating the tool’s configuration data:

* ***flow_definition.json***: It includes the tool's canvas definitions (node definitions) and AI node configurations, including prompts, hyper parameters, and timeout information.
* ***app_definition.json:*** It includes general information about the tool version and guardrails.
* ***env_variables.json***: It includes the environment variables set for the tool. [Learn more](../tools/configure-a-tool.md){:target="_blank"}.
