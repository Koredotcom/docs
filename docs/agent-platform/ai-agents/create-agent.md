# Set up an AI Agent

An AI Agent is a configurable, goal-driven component that can understand user input, reason using context, and take actions by invoking tools or delegating tasks. Setting up an agent involves defining its intended purpose, configuring its core functions, and ensuring it has the necessary tools and resources to perform its tasks. It also includes defining the agent's boundaries to govern its actions within those boundaries.

<!-- ## Agents Page

The **Agents** page displays all agents associated with the Agentic app as individual cards, providing clear visibility into each agent's connected tools and configuration status. It shows the total number of agents in the app.

Key highlights

* Each agent card shows the connected tools with identifiable icons.
* Highlights **Proxy Agents** with an external icon and hover tooltips revealing connected apps.
* Agents needing LLM configuration show a **Configure LLM** button for quick setup.
* Displays the total agent count in the page header, with **Explore Marketplace** and **New Agent** options always visible.

## Agent Setup Overview

### Prerequisites

Before setting up an agent, ensure the following: 

* [Create an Agentic App](agentic-apps/create-app.md) to add the agent to. Agents must be associated with an app and cannot exist independently.
* Configure at least one AI Model with tool-calling support. The platform supports OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, and Azure OpenAI. [See Add an External Model](../models/external-models/add-an-external-model-using-easy-integration.md).
* Verify you have the App Owner or App Developer role in the workspace. Users with Viewer access can't create agents. 
* Review the [App Component Limits](agentic-apps/settings/app-component-limits.md) to confirm that the app hasn't reached the maximum number of agents allowed. 

### Choosing How to Create an Agent

The first step in setting up an agent is deciding how it will be created. Depending on your use case, you may:

* Use a prebuilt agent from the Marketplace.
* Connect an external agent that's hosted elsewhere.
* Build an agent from scratch with full control over its configuration.

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>
<b>Option</b>
   </td>
   <td><b>When to use</b>
   </td>
   <td><b>What you configure</b>
   </td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
   <td><a href="../create-from-scratch/">From Scratch</a>
   </td>
   <td>You want full control
   </td>
   <td>Configure everything for the agent - Profile, instructions, tools, and knowledge. 
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><a href="../external-agents/">Connect External Agent</a>
   </td>
   <td>You already have an agent hosted elsewhere
   </td>
   <td>Connection details
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><a href="../create-from-marketplace/">From Marketplace</a>
   </td>
   <td>You want to use a  preconfigured, ready-to-use agent
   </td>
   <td>Requires minimal edits
   </td>
  </tr>
  
 
</table>


This selection determines the setup flow and the configurations available during agent creation. For step-by-step instructions, refer to the corresponding guides for each option.

## Defining the Agent Profile 

The agent profile establishes the agent’s identity and purpose. It specifies the AI agent's primary objectives and key responsibilities. The profile helps the system (or orchestrator) understand what the agent is designed to do and helps identify the most suitable agent for a task.

---

## Configuring Agent Definition

The Agent Definition is the system prompt for the agent. Write clear, scoped instructions that describe the agent's role and capabilities, the tasks it can perform to support decision-making. It establishes what the agent can do and how it should operate, ensuring that the goals are effectively aligned. Well-structured instructions ensure the agent responds consistently and follows expected workflows.

---

## Adding Knowledge

The platform provides powerful search functionality across diverse content sources using the Search AI application, which supports Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based search across enterprise knowledge bases, document repositories, FAQs, and external systems. You can link to one or more Search AI applications in the same workspace and account and access them as Knowledge Tools for the agent to answer user queries.

---

## Adding Tools 

Tools are foundational components that empower agents to perform purposeful actions. They serve as the functional extensions of an agent’s intelligence, enabling it to interact with third-party applications, retrieve information, perform logic-based operations, and trigger workflows across complex environments. For example, tools can be used for:

* Fetching data from external systems
* Creating or updating records
* Triggering workflows or APIs

Each tool expands the agent’s capabilities and allows it to interact with other applications or services. Agent Platform offers three types of tools:

* Workflow Tools
* Code Tools
* MCP Tools

---

## Adding Delegation Logic

Delegation logic is applicable only when the agentic application uses the *Adaptive Network orchestration pattern*.

For this pattern, you must configure delegation rules that define how an agent routes or hands off a user query to another agent within the application. These rules determine which agent is best suited to handle specific intents, tasks, or contexts.

Clear delegation logic ensures predictable and reliable agent behavior.

Note: If your application uses any orchestration pattern other than Adaptive Network, delegation configuration isn't required and this option won't be available.
