# Manage Account Billing and Usage

The **Billing** section helps you monitor and analyze your Agent Platform expenses through detailed usage metrics and cost breakdowns. You can track computational costs across tools, models, guardrails, and custom script deployments to make data-driven decisions about your resource utilization.

## Accessing Usage Information

Steps to access the Usage page:

1. Log in to your account and click **Autonomous Agents** from the list of modules.
2. Click **Settings** on the top navigation bar.
3. On the left navigation pane, click **Billing** > **Usage**.

The Usage page displays the following tabs for billing and usage:

* **Overview**: Provides a high-level summary of your resource consumption including:
    * **Runs**: Shows current tool run usage against your total allocation.
    * **Credits**: Displays the number of credits consumed out of the total available credits, along with the corresponding percentage. A dynamic pie chart visually represents this data, showing the distribution of total credits, including usage by models and custom script deployments. Each metric is color-coded and identified through a legend for easy reference. Hover over the chart to view the actual values for each usage type.
    * **Usage Trend**: Visual representation of tool runs and model credit consumption over time.
* **Tools**: Shows all tool activities and their operational status.

## Usage Overview

The **Overview** section summarizes expenses and usage patterns across your tools, models, guardrails, and custom scripts. The following usage information is displayed on the tab:

* **Runs**: This field indicates the usage of tool runs, showing the proportion of capacity consumed compared to the total available runs. For example, if 45 out of 10,000 available tool runs have been utilized, indicating that 0.45% of the total capacity has been consumed.
* **Credits**: This field displays the total credit usage, showing the proportion of credits used across models, guardrails, and custom scripts compared to the total available credits. It also includes the credits used to host guardrails. For example, if 212 credits have been used out of a total allocation of 300 credits, indicating that 70.72% of your available model credits have been utilized.
* **Usage trend**: This visual representation shows tool runs, models, guardrails, and custom script credits consumed over time. Use the calendar feature to view changes over a defined timeline, such as daily, weekly, monthly, or any custom date range.

## Tools Usage

The Tools tab displays a comprehensive list of tools associated with the account. It includes only those tools that have been deployed at least once; it does not include ‘In development’ tools.  

The following usage information is displayed on the tab:

* **Total Tools**: The total number of tools in the account.
* **Total runs**: The total number of runs by all the tools.
* **Tool name**: The name assigned to the tool.
* **Runs**: The number of times the tool was inferred. 
* **Owner Name**: The name of the user who created the tool.

## Models Usage

The **Models** tab displays a comprehensive list of open-source and fine-tuning models in the account and the computational cost of storing, fine-tuning, and hosting each model.

<img src="../images/models-usage.png" alt="Billing Models tab" title="Billing Models tab" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

If there are multiple deployments of the same model, the usage data is displayed for each deployment in the drill-down view. [Learn more](./billing-and-usage.md#viewing-deployment-level-information){:target="_blank"}.

The following usage metrics summarize data for all the deployments:

* **Total models**: The total number of models in the account.
* **Total credits**: The total credits used by all the models (including all the deployments).
* **Fine-tuning credits**: The number of credits used for fine-tuning the models. The number of credits are based on factors like the size of the training data, the model complexity, the number of training epochs, the type of hardware used, and other parameters.
* **Hosting credits**: The total number of credits used to cover the cost of deploying and hosting models on GPUs.
When you deploy a model on powerful GPUs, each GPU instance is considered a "replica", which requires the allocation of hosting credits. For example, if your model runs on one A100 GPU, that counts as one replica and consumes a specific amount of hosting credits. If demand increases and you need to deploy a second A100 GPU to handle additional user requests, you will now have two replicas and be charged for both, requiring twice the number of hosting credits.

The following information is displayed for each model record:

* **Model name**: The name of the model.
* **Type**: The type of model used: Fine-tuned or Base.
* **Credits used**: The credits consumed by the deployment.
* **Last deployed on**: The date when the model was last deployed.

### Viewing Deployment-level Information
