# Account Limits and Notifications

When users create an account with Agent Platform, they receive free credits - 75 model credits and 10,000 tool runs by default. The model credits are used for model inference and setting guardrails, while tool runs are consumed when inferring tools. Once the free credits are fully exhausted, users will no longer be able to perform these actions. To continue using the Platform’s services after the free credits are exhausted, users must add credits to their account by [contacting Support](https://support.kore.ai).

## Exhaustion alerts for Model Credits and Tool Runs

The Platform provides multiple alerts and warning notifications to inform users when their credits are running low or have expired. These notifications are crucial for:

* Helping users monitor their credit usage.
* Allowing proactive management to prevent service disruptions.
* Reminding users to add credits in advance to ensure uninterrupted access to the Platform's features.

### Notification Methods

**Banner Alerts:** A banner appears at the top of the page to inform users of their usage status. The alert banners are displayed at 20%, 50%, 70%, 80%, and 90% exhaustion of model credits and tool runs, giving users ample notice to take action. These banners ensure users are aware of low credits/runs in real time.

Banners will appear at the top of the page in the following cases:  

* Free credits expired: Users will see a fixed top banner prompting them to upgrade their plan.
* Model credits/tool runs expired: Users will see a fixed top banner prompting them to upgrade or top up their current plan.  
* Model credits/tool runs low: Users will see a removable banner encouraging them to top up or upgrade their plan.


**Email Notifications:** The system automatically sends email notifications to users when their credit levels fall below a specified threshold, including warnings for both model credits and tool runs. Emails will be sent at 50%, 70%, 80%, and 90% exhaustion of model credits and tool runs, giving users ample notice to take action. These emails include instructions on the next steps to resolve the issue, such as adding more credits by contacting the Platform support.

As credits are consumed, the dynamic pie chart indicates how much of the available credits have been used. The icon's color dynamically changes based on your credit usage, providing a clear visual indicator of your remaining balance.

* **Green (Good Balance)**: The icon is mostly or fully green, indicating that more than 75% of credits are available and the user has a healthy credit balance.
* **Yellow/Orange (Moderate Usage)**: As credits are used, the icon turns yellow or orange, indicating that 25% - 75% of credits remain and that the user is using a moderate amount of credits.
* **Red (Low Credits)**: The icon turns red when less than 25% of credits remain, warning the user to add credits soon to avoid disruption.
* **Triangle Icon (Credits Exhausted)**: When credits are fully depleted, the icon changes to a triangle (associated with a warning), indicating that no credits are left. Users must add credits to resume services like model deployments or tool runs.
