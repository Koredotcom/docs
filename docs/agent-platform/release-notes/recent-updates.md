# Agent Platform Release Notes

This document provides information on the feature updates and enhancements introduced in the recent Agent Platform releases.

## v1.6.0 January 31, 2026

<u> Minor Release </u>

This release empowers you to build more sophisticated, secure, and flexible AI solutions. Key updates include an expanded agent-creation workflow and AI-assisted prompt refinement. Security enhancements give workspace administrators granular control over tool logs and improve access management. The developer experience is significantly enhanced with support for environment variables in workflow tools, improved access control for security, native integration with Google Vertex AI-hosted Gemini models, and the addition of over 40 new models from Google and OpenAI.

<font size="4">Multi-Agent Orchestration</font>

**Enhanced Agent Creation Flow**

Agent creation now supports three paths: building agents from scratch, importing pre-built agents from the Marketplace, or adding externally deployed agents for orchestration. Each path provides a tailored setup flow with agent-specific configurations. This streamlines agent onboarding with guided experiences and eliminates the previous two-step enablement process across apps and agent profiles.

**AI-Assisted Prompt Refinement**

The prompt editor now includes AI-assisted refinement, enabling users to easily improve and optimize prompts directly within the editor. This feature reduces iteration cycles and improves prompt accuracy through clearer, more effective definitions, making prompt writing faster and easier.

**Note**: This feature is in preview and can be enabled upon request.

<!--**Enhanced Security for Session Logs**

The Secure Logs feature gives workspace admins granular control over access to detailed session logs and sensitive conversation data. When enabled, developers cannot view detailed logs unless administrators explicitly grant them access. Admins can configure access at the role level or apply restrictions across the entire enterprise workspace, ensuring sensitive customer interactions and debugging data remain visible only to authorized personnel. 

This feature applies only to environment-level logs, such as production and UAT, not to logs in draft versions during development.
-->

<font size="4">No-code & Pro-Code Tools</font>

**Enhanced Access Control for Tool Logs**

Tool-level role management has been enhanced with separate permissions for tool log visibility, allowing administrators to control access to the tool log list and detailed execution logs independently. These permissions support three access levels - detailed access, view-only, and no access, providing finer control over log.

**Environment Variable for Workflow Tools in Agentic Apps**

Workflow Tools created within or scoped to Agentic Apps can now use environment variables defined at the app level. Access is managed through namespaces—when you attach a namespace to a tool, all environment variables within that namespace become available for use.

Workflow Tools created outside an Agentic App and not linked to any app cannot access namespaces or app-level environment variables.

## v1.5.0 January 17, 2026

<u> Minor Release </u>

This release empowers you to build more sophisticated, secure, and flexible AI solutions. You can now improve voice interactions with direct real-time integration for single-agent apps,  create better user experiences with customizable waiting messages while agents process requests, and maintain tighter security controls with configurable session log settings.
Access tool outputs directly through Artifacts for custom client-side experiences and expand deployment options with open-source LLM support for agentic applications. Additional improvements include enhanced PII handling in workflows, improved selection of context variables, and configurable default user roles for streamlined team onboarding.

<font size="4">Multi-Agent Orchestration</font>

**Direct Real-Time Voice Integration for Single-Agent Apps**

The Single Agent Orchestration Pattern now supports real-time models, which significantly reduce response latency when your agentic app contains only one agent. The platform now automatically bypasses the supervisor routing layer and connects users directly to the agent, eliminating unnecessary orchestration overhead. This improvement is especially beneficial for voice interactions with real-time models where speed is critical, and it works automatically without requiring any configuration changes.

[Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../ai-agents/agentic-apps/orchestrator.md#single-agent-configuration)

**Customizable Waiting Messages**

The Waiting Experience feature enhances voice interactions by streaming natural filler messages during processing delays, reducing perceived latency and ensuring smoother conversations. This feature is now publicly available and includes a customizable prompt editor for creating AI-generated dynamic waiting messages. This feature is supported only in ASR/TTS mode (not available for real-time models).

[Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../ai-agents/agentic-apps/settings/app-configurations.md#waiting-experience)

**Tool Output Artifacts in Response Payload**

You can now configure tools to include their outputs as artifacts in the final response payload. This new capability allows you to capture specific tool execution results and make them available under the ‘artifacts’ key in the response, enabling downstream channels and applications to access structured data for custom processing, display logic, or integration workflows. Artifact inclusion is configurable at the individual tool level, giving you precise control over which tool outputs are exposed in the response.

[Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../apis/agentic-apps/execute.md)

<font size="4">No-code & Pro-Code Tools</font>

**PII Handling for Workflow Tools**

The Agent Platform extends existing PII handling to Workflow Tools, ensuring sensitive data is securely processed while preventing exposure in logs, traces, or model outputs. Before a Workflow Tool starts execution, input fields are automatically scanned for declared PII patterns. Inputs identified as PII are masked as configured and passed to the tool in redacted form. If the Workflow tools are granted access to the original value in the PII configuration:

* The tool can securely unredact and use the PII internally for execution.
* All monitoring, debugging logs, and execution traces continue to display only masked values.

[Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../ai-agents/tools/workflow-tools.md#2-app-scoped-tools)

**Improved Context Variable Selection in the Flow Builder**

Selecting context variables is now faster and more intuitive. When users type `{{` in any field that supports context variables, a dynamic dropdown appears showing all available variables grouped by node, including environment variables defined at the workflow-tool level. This eliminates the hassle of manually entering the full path. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../ai-agents/context-object.md#using-the-context-object)

*Coming Soon:* Support for selecting and referencing agentic app-level environment variables in Workflow Tools is currently in progress and will be available in an upcoming release.
