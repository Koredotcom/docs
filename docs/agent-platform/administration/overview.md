# Settings Console for Account Admins

Agent Platform’s **Settings** console is a centralized management interface that provides administrators with the tools and functionalities to configure, monitor, and manage the Platform’s system configurations to manage the following:

1. [Users](../settings/user-management/users.md){:target="_blank"}
2. [Roles and permissions](../settings/user-management/role-management.md){:target="_blank"}
3. [Automated synchronization](../settings/user-management/settings/active-directory.md){:target="_blank"} of user data from Enterprise AD, plus configuration of user profile fields and email notifications.
4. [Integrations](../settings/integrations/about-integrations.md){:target="_blank"} 
5. [Manage Custom Scripts](../settings/manage-custom-scripts/custom-scripts.md){:target="_blank"}
6. [Manage Guardrails](../guardrails/overview.md){:target="_blank"} 
7. [Monitoring](../settings/monitoring/overview.md){:target="_blank"}: [Audit Logs](../settings/monitoring/audit-logs.md){:target="_blank"}, [Tools Analytics Dashboard](../settings/monitoring/analytics/tools-analytics-dashboard.md){:target="_blank"}, [Model Analytics Dashboard](../settings/monitoring/analytics/model-analytics-dashboard.md){:target="_blank"}, [Model Traces](../settings/monitoring/analytics/model-traces.md){:target="_blank"}, and [Monitoring Custom Scripts](../settings/monitoring/monitoring-custom-scripts.md){:target="_blank"}.
8. Security and Control: [Single Sign On](../settings/security-and-control/single-sign-on.md){:target="_blank"}, [Authorization Profile](../settings/security-and-control/authorization-profile.md){:target="_blank"}, and [API Scopes](../settings/security-and-control/api-scopes.md){:target="_blank"}.

## Levels of Users Management 

The **Settings** Console provides administrators comprehensive control and visibility on the user management features available at the following levels, facilitating proactive and improved management.

* **Account level**: At the account level, administrators can manage users, their roles, and permissions throughout the Platform account. This includes tasks such as inviting users, establishing automatic data synchronization from the enterprise Active Directory (AD), and setting up access controls for modules including tool creation, model management (including access, deployment, and export), integrations, user management, audit logs, security controls, model guardrails, and others.

* **Tool level**: User management within the Platform is focused on tool management, emphasizing individual tool deployments and configurations. Each tool's owner has the authority to invite individual users, customize their permissions and access levels, and manage tasks such as creating and deleting tools, assigning roles, overseeing deployments, configuring guardrails, and managing API apps and keys.

This post describes how to access the **Settings** Console and summarizes the modules and features available.

## Actions You Can Perform on the Settings Console

The modules and the capabilities supported on the <b>Settings</b> Console include the following:

**Users**

* Add a new user to your account and assign a system role to them via email invitation or user information file import.
* View and track the summary of counts for total, active, inactive, and locked users.
* View the details of all the users linked to your account like Name, Email ID, Account Role, and Status.
* Select and delete one or more users from your account.
* Unlock the locked users.
* Reassign a default or custom role to a user.

[Learn more](../settings/user-management/users.md){:target="_blank"} about this feature.

**Roles and Permissions**

* View system-generated roles for <b>account</b> and <b>tool</b> role types.
* Duplicate the roles and make custom changes.
* View the enabled/disabled access controls for various modules and permissions for system roles.
* Add new custom roles for tool and account types, enable/disable access, and set access controls (full, view, custom, and no access) for various modules and permissions assigned to the roles. 

[Learn more](../settings/user-management/role-management.md){:target="_blank"} about this feature.

**Settings**

[Sync and import key user information](../settings/user-management/settings/active-directory.md){:target="_blank"} from your organization's AD by doing the following: 

* Configuring the connection to your AD.
* Importing user data from all or specific organization units.
* Selecting and managing default AD user fields, or adding custom fields, and defining inclusion and exclusion rules for data import and sync.
* Configuring AD auto sync schedules to ensure user data on the Platform remains up-to-date.

Additionally, you can do the following:

* View sync history and reports to monitor successful and failed AD syncs.
* Manage the ability to view and edit default and custom user data fields.
* Configure how joining requests from new users are handled, including automatic approval options.
* Choose whether users should receive email notifications upon being added to your account via email invitation or AD sync.

[Learn more](../settings/user-management/settings/active-directory.md){:target="_blank"} about this feature.

**Integrations**

Connect to third-party services using prebuilt, secure, and configurable integrations. These connections can be used to access the linked services via the [Integration node](../ai-agents/tools/tool-flows/types-of-nodes/integration-node.md){:target="_blank"} in the Tools automation flow. [Learn more](../settings/integrations/about-integrations.md){:target="_blank"}.

**Manage Custom Scripts**

Use the script wizard in the **Settings**  console to upload a script definition file in the supported format, configure it, and import a custom script. Once configured, you can deploy the script to make it available for use across the platform.

You can also:

- Un-deploy, export, or delete a script as needed.

- Re-deploy the script after updates or changes.

- Use the script in multiple locations across the Platform, such as in the **Function node** of a tool automation flow.

Other capabilities include:

- View configuration and deployment details in the script's Overview page.

- Track deployment history and monitor version changes.

- Check deployment status and take actions like re-deploying, exporting, or deleting.

- Create and manage API keys to securely access the script’s API endpoint.

- View and copy endpoint code for use in external systems or integrations.

- Select and execute the script from the Function node when building automation flows.

**Guardrails**

View pre-deployed guardrail models that apply scanners to prompt input and output text across all tools. [Learn more](../guardrails/overview.md){:target="_blank"}.

**Monitoring**

- Track the audit logs of all user activities within your account and quickly troubleshoot issues with real-time event tracking. [Learn more](../settings/monitoring/audit-logs.md){:target="_blank"}.

- Review Tool Performance Metrics and take informed decisions on the **Tools Analytics** dashboard. [Learn more](../settings/monitoring/analytics/tools-analytics-dashboard.md){:target="_blank"}.

* Review, track, and fine tune model performance using model-specific metrics. [Learn more](../settings/monitoring/analytics/model-analytics-dashboard.md){:target="_blank"}.
* Track and monitor run-level metrics and metadata for each model execution to determine the best and worst performers. [Learn more](../settings/monitoring/analytics/model-traces.md){:target="_blank"}.
* Track custom script executions across runs and logs for deployments (endpoints), Function nodes, and API nodes. The **All Runs** section shows performance metrics (response times, failure rates) and execution details, while the **Logs** section provides runtime debugging information. Administrators can filter by date, search for runs or logs, and copy IDs to identify and resolve script issues efficiently. [Learn more](../settings/monitoring/monitoring-custom-scripts.md){:target="_blank"}.

**Security and Control**

- Enable or disable **Single Sign-On (SSO)** for your account and other users to streamline authentication and enhance password security. [Learn more](../settings/security-and-control/single-sign-on.md){:target="_blank"}.
- Set up authorization profiles that enable your tools, models, and AI agents to access external web services securely. [Learn more](../settings/security-and-control/authorization-profile.md){:target="_blank"}.
- Create and manage API-scoped apps and keys to securely authenticate and authorize access to specific endpoints based on selected scopes. [Learn more](../settings/security-and-control/api-scopes.md){:target="_blank"}.
