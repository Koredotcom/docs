# DocSearch Node – Power Your Flows with Context-Driven Search

The **DocSearch Node** is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-powered component that enhances the real-time discovery and retrieval of information chunks from available resources through an established Search AI app connection. Indexed and high-quality content is fetched from your Sources repository, enabling fast, precise, and context-aware responses to user queries.

## Key Capabilities

* **RAG-Powered Search**: Combines traditional retrieval (search, databases) with generative LLMs as follows:
    * **Retrieval & Pre-processing**: Queries indexed content using advanced algorithms, then refines results through tokenization and filtering. 
    * **Grounded Generation**: Integrates refined results with LLMs for accurate and context-rich responses. 
* **Seamless SearchAI Integration**: Connects to your Search AI app to query indexed documents and return results via the Answer Generation engine.
* **Dynamic Query Support**: Supports static and dynamic inputs for flexible, context-aware search automation.
* **Meta Filter Configuration**: Use optional meta filters to refine results, or search across all linked documents by default.
* **User Redirection Option**: Redirect users to the full Search AI App for a more comprehensive search experience when needed.
* **Precision and Personalization**: Delivers context-aware, intent-driven responses aligned to the query, ensuring accurate, relevant, and user-specific outcomes.
* **Flow Integration**: Seamlessly connect DocSearch with other nodes to pass queries and process responses.


## Common Use Cases

* **Document Retrieval**: Retrieve relevant content from indexed sources, such as manuals, policies, or help articles, based on user queries.
* **Contextual Answer Generation**: Deliver AI-generated responses grounded in retrieved documents using the RAG framework.
* **Knowledge Base Search**: Search internal wikis, technical docs, or training material with support for dynamic inputs and filters.
* **User Query Handling**: Accept real-time input queries from other nodes to personalize search results in the workflow context.


## Example Use Case

A retail bank uses the **DocSearch Node** to automate responses to frequently asked questions about loans, accounts, and card services. When a user asks, “*What documents are required to apply for a home loan based on my income?*”, the node dynamically passes the query to a connected Search AI App, which searches, indexes, and fetches relevant information chunks from internal resources such as loan policy documents, eligibility criteria, and process guidelines. It then returns a precise, context-aware response, reducing call center load and improving self-service efficiency.


## How It Works

The **DocSearch Node** integrates seamlessly into your workflows, accepting user queries as static text or dynamic variables referencing other node outputs. It connects to a pre-configured Search AI App on the platform to retrieve relevant content from your Sources repository using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. You can define meta filters manually or fetch them via the Answer Generation API to generate refined, context-aware responses. The node fully integrates within the canvas and optionally allows redirection to the full Search AI interface.

In this document, you will learn how to add and configure DocSearch Nodes with Search AI connections, set up query inputs and meta filters, handle response outputs, and test the search-driven interactions within your automation flows.

## Steps to Add and Configure the Node

Configuring the DocSearch Node consists of the following steps:

1. [Set up a Search AI application and the information source for AI for Process integration](../types-of-nodes/docsearch-node.md#step-1-set-up-search-ai-app){:target="_blank"}.
2. [Link the Search AI application in AI for Process](../types-of-nodes/docsearch-node.md#step-2-link-the-search-ai-app-in-ai-for-process){:target="_blank"}.
3. [Add and configure the DocSearch node](../types-of-nodes/docsearch-node.md#step-3-add-and-configure-a-docsearch-node){:target="_blank"}.
4. [Test the Workflow](../types-of-nodes/docsearch-node.md#step-4-test-the-flow) you have built.

## Step 1: Set up Search AI App

The integration of Search AI with AI for Process involves setting up a Search AI application, configuring it for integration, and modifying AI for Process to interact with Search AI in response to specific conditions or events. Search AI provides REST APIs that enable seamless interaction with any application.

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Accessing the Output</p>
<p>The answer
(extracted chunks) from the node can be accessed via the context variable (key) in the output path. This key is dynamic and depends on the API response. The
format is <code>{{context.steps.<<<b>nodename</b>>>.dynamic
path}}</code>. For example, it
could be <code>context.steps.DocSearch.response.response.answer</code> in one case or <code>context.steps.DocSearch.response.response.response.answer</code> in another.

Check the sample response from Search AI to find the correct key that holds the content.
Use that key in your workflow. You may also need to extract multiple chunks from different keys.</p></div>
