<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>If no versions exist for a workflow, the dropdown list is empty. By default, data for all workflow versions is displayed unless a specific version is selected.</p></div>

## Workflow Performance Data Widgets

The **Workflows Analytics** dashboard displays the widgets mentioned below to represent the [Workflow-specific performance metrics](../analytics/workflows-analytics-dashboard.md#workflow-specific-metrics){:target="_blank"}. The graphs update automatically when a different workflow version is selected.

### How it Works

1. Select the required date/range in the [global timeline filter](../analytics/workflows-analytics-dashboard.md#global-timeline-filters){:target="_blank"}.
2. Select the **workflow Name** and (optional) **workflow Version**.
3. The widgets display an hourly graph for 24 hours on a single day and a daily graph for the respective metrics for a date range.

### workflow Runs

This widget features two dynamic graphs illustrating successful and failed requests executed by the workflow during the selected period in the [global timeline filter](../analytics/workflows-analytics-dashboard.md#global-timeline-filters){:target="_blank"}. The Y-axis represents the **Total Number of Requests**, while the X-axis indicates the **Date**. 

**Key Features**

* Successful runs are displayed in green, while failed runs are shown in red.
* The **Total Number of Requests** (Y-axis) automatically scales to accommodate runs executed across different date selections.
* Hover over a data point on the success and failure line graphs to view the counts for Total Requests and the successful and failed requests executed by the workflow at that specific date and time. For example, you can check the successful and unsuccessful request executions at 11:25 AM on January 16, 2024.
<img src="../images/tooltip-feature.png" alt="tooltip feature" title="tooltip feature" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p><ul><li>The widget shows data only for the duration that the workflow was deployed in your account. For instance, if workflow A was active for 4 days last week and undeployed for the next 3 days, selecting a 7-day view will display data solely for those 4 active days and the associated request times.</li>
<li>The graph will show curves only when requests are processed by the workflow. If no requests are processed during an hour or day, no data points will appear.</li></ul></p></div>

**Best Practices**

You can do the following to analyze workflow performance:

* **Performance Tracking**: By viewing successful and failed requests, you can monitor the workflow’s performance, identifying how often the workflow completes tasks successfully versus when they fail for the same or different dates.
* **Trend Analysis**: Tracking workflow runs across different periods provides insights into performance trends, identifying peak and low performance periods.
* **Real-Time Monitoring**: The widget allows you to monitor workflow performance in real-time, enabling quick responses to sudden spikes in failures or performance drops.
* **Comparative Assessment**: Evaluate the performance of different workflow versions to determine the most effective option.

### Avg. Workflow Response Time

This widget features a line graph illustrating the ART taken by the workflow version to execute each request during the selected period in the [global timeline filter](../analytics/workflows-analytics-dashboard.md#global-timeline-filters){:target="_blank"}. The Y-axis represents the **Avg. Response Time**, while the X-axis indicates the **Date**. 

**Key Features**

* A blue line graph represents the Average Response Time (ART) values for the selected period. If a single day is selected, the graph displays hourly ART values, while selecting a date range represents daily ART values.
* The **Avg. Response Time** (Y-axis) automatically scales to accommodate real-time response times per request.

**Best Practices**

You can do the following to analyze workflow performance:

**Single Day**

* View the average workflow response time for each hourly request within a day. For instance, if the workflow executes 100 requests between 12 PM and 1 PM, each with its own response time, the average of these values is represented by the graph line. Hover over the corresponding data point on the graph to view the ART for a specific hour. The tooltip shows the selected date & time, ART for the hour, and the no.of requests processed during that hour.
* View the overall ART, which is the total of the ART for all hours combined during the selected day.

<img src="../images/overall-art.png" alt="overall art" title="overall art" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

**Date Range**

* View the ART of a workflow for requests processed daily over the specified date range. For example, if you select the date range between September 1 and September 30, the ART for each day is combined to show the graph line. Hover over the corresponding data point on the graph to see the ART for a specific date and time. The tooltip shows the selected date, ART for the day, and the no.of requests processed on that date.

* View the overall ART, which is the total of the ART for all days in the selected date range.
<img src="../images/overall-art-for-date-range.png" alt="overall art for date range" title="overall art for date range" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The system calculates the ART for all requests within each hour (hourly ART). It then combines the hourly ART for all hours daily to determine the Daily ART. Finally, the Daily ART values for the selected date range are aggregated to compute the overall ART.</p></div>

**Generic**

* **Performance Evaluation**: ART helps assess how quickly the workflow responds to requests during different periods, giving insights into overall efficiency.
* **Bottleneck Identification**: Sudden spikes in ART can highlight delays or inefficiencies, allowing for targeted troubleshooting.
* **Optimization**: Monitoring ART over time helps identify areas for improvement, leading to faster response times and optimized workflows.
* **Trend Analysis**: Tracking ART across different periods helps uncover patterns in workflow performance, providing data-driven opportunities for enhancement.
* **Comparative Assessment**: Evaluate the performance of different workflow versions to assess their response times to requests.

### Nodes Execution

This widget displays a line graph showing the number of nodes (including all node types) executed for each event run during a workflow for the selected workflow version and period (as selected in the [Global timeline filter](../analytics/workflows-analytics-dashboard.md#global-timeline-filters)){:target="_blank"}. The Y-axis represents the **Number of Nodes Executed**, while the X-axis shows the **Date**.

**Rate Limit**

The **Nodes Execution** widget displays a graph up to your account's maximum subscribed rate limit, indicated by a red line. For example, if your subscription allows 8,000 node executions, the graph will show data for a maximum of 8,000 nodes during the selected period. Once this limit is reached, an error message will appear, notifying you that the threshold has been reached and no further node executions can occur.

<img src="../images/nodes-execution-rate-limit.png" alt="rate limit" title="rate limit" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

**Key Features**

<ul><li>A blue line graph represents the node executions for the selected period. If a single day is selected, the graph displays hourly node executions, while selecting a date range represents daily node executions.</li>
<li>The <b>Number of Nodes Executed</b> (Y-axis) is fixed and accommodates the maximum rate limit subscription.</li>
<li>A red line highlights the maximum rate limit.</li>
<li>Hover over the required data point on the graph to view the following information:</li></ul>
