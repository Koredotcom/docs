# Workspace 

A *workspace* represents a logical grouping of applications, workflows, and configurations, typically organized by teams or projects. Workspaces bring organization and structure to how apps are grouped and accessed. It determines **what apps and data are accessible**, **what actions are allowed**, and **which configurations apply** based on the currently selected workspace.

By default, when a new account is created, a default workspace is created and assigned. When a new app is created, it's automatically associated with the workspace. 

Points to Note:

* Every app is tied to a specific workspace. It can't be moved or accessed across workspaces (use import/export to move apps across workspaces).
* Workflows created within a workspace are only available to apps in that workspace. (use import/export to move workflows across workspaces).
* All configurations, including AI Model configurations, settings, auth profiles, and permissions, are maintained separately for each workspace.
* Each workspace has its own set of deployment environments.

The current workspace is displayed at the top right corner in the Agent Platform UI.

Click on **Browse all Workspaces** to view the complete list of workspaces. On switching between workspaces, 

* The apps and workflows are refreshed to show the ones from the new workspace. 
* Permissions are also based on the user's role in the new workspace. 
* Settings, memory stores, models, and deployment environments reflect workspace-specific configurations. 

**Features of Workspace Switcher**

* **Default workspace**: Users can mark any workspace as their default. This workspace will automatically load when logging into a new session.
* **Search and Browse Workspaces**: Easily locate workspaces using the search bar or browse through the full list using pagination controls. 
* **Request access to inaccessible workspaces**: My Workspaces tab lists the workspaces that the user has access to, and inaccessible ones are listed under Other Workspaces. Users can directly request access to a workspace from this list.
* **User Role**: The workspace switcher indicates the total number of members in the workspace and the user’s role in the workspace. In the **workspace list view**, each workspace entry indicates the **owner**, helping users understand workspace ownership clearly.
