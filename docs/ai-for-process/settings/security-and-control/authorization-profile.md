# Secure Account Access Using Authorization Profiles

AI for Process offers a secure and streamlined way to manage authorization when integrating with external web services. By configuring **Authorization (Auth) Profiles**, users can enforce access control policies while ensuring data privacy and regulatory compliance.

Whether connecting to external or commercial models via custom APIs or integrating workflows through the AI or API node, the platform provides a structured framework to handle user authorization. This simplifies security configurations, strengthens access control, and enables smooth identity verification across various services.

Key capabilities of managing Auth Profiles on AI for Process include:



* **Defining Authorization Rules**
Specify auth methods and requirements, such as passwords, token fields, and custom authorization parameters.
* **Securing Access**
Ensure only authorized users or systems can connect to external services, protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access.
* **Profile Reusability** 
Reuse Auth Profiles across multiple integrations and endpoints for consistency, reduced configuration effort, and streamlined maintenance.
* **Connection Testing and Validation**
Verify that identity and authorization tokens are correctly passed to external services, ensuring the integration is secure and functional.

## Access Authorization Profile

To access the feature, follow the steps below:

1. Log in → In AI for Process Modules top menu → Click **Settings**.
   <img src="../images/aip-settings-access.png" alt="access settings" title="access settings" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

2. Click **Security & Control** > **Authorization profile** on the left navigation menu.

## Supported Auth Models

You can enable a single auth profile or create custom profiles tailored for accessing third-party web services. These profiles support the following authorization types:


### OAuth V2

OAuth 2.0 (OAuth2) is a standard authorization framework that enables applications to obtain limited, secure, and token-based access to a user’s account on an HTTP service, such as Google, Facebook, or GitHub without exposing the user's credentials. It supports multiple grant types, uses scopes for permissions, and enables long-term access with refresh tokens, making it ideal for API authentication.

**Key Features**

* **Secure, Token-Based Authorization** – Grants access without sharing user credentials, using short-lived access tokens. 

* **Multiple Authorization Flows** – Supports different grant types (e.g., Authorization Code, Client Credentials) for various use cases. 

* **Scope-Based Access Control** – Users can grant apps limited permissions (e.g., read-only access). 

* **Refresh Token Support** –  Enables seamless re-authorization without requiring user login. 

* **Third-Party & Scalable Integration** – Widely adopted for API authentication, allowing secure third-party access (e.g., "*Sign in with Google*").

### OAuth V2 Client Credential

The Client Credentials flow is one of the OAuth 2.0 authorization grant types. It is primarily used in Machine-to-Machine (M2M) scenarios, where an application needs to access resources or perform operations on its own behalf — without user interaction.

**How it Works**

1. The client application authenticates with the Authorization Server by presenting its client ID and client secret.

2. Upon successful authentication, the Authorization Server issues an access token.

3. The client uses this token to authenticate API requests to the Resource Server.

**Key Features**

* **Client Credentials**: This flow uses the client's unique identifier (client ID) and a secret (client secret) to authenticate the application with the authorization server. 
* **No User Interaction**: Unlike flows involving user authorization (e.g., authorization code flow), the client credentials flow doesn't require the user to log in or grant permissions. 
* **Machine-to-Machine (M2M) Communication**: This flow is ideal for scenarios where one application needs to access resources owned by another application, such as microservices or server-to-server communication. 
* **Resource Access**: The client uses the acquired access token to interact with the resource server and access protected resources. 
* **Access Token**: The authorization server issues an access token, a short-lived credential that allows the client to access specific resources. 

## Add Authorization Profile

To add a new Auth profile, you must first set up the required auth fields with the steps below: 

1. [Navigate](../security-and-control/authorization-profile.md#access-authorization-profile){:target="_blank"} to the **Authorization Profile** feature.
2. Click **Create Authorization Profile** if this is your first auth profile.
<img src="../images/click-create-auth-profile.png" alt="create auth profile" title="create auth profile" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">  

Otherwise, click **Add new auth**.
<img src="../images/add-new-auth-profile.png" alt="add new auth profile" title="add new auth profile" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">  

<ol start="3"><li>In the <b>New Authorization Mechanism</b> dialog, select the required option for <b>Authorization Type</b>.</li> 
<img src="../images/select-oauthv2.png" alt="select oauth v2" title="select oauth v2" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;"></ol>  
<ol start="4"><li>In the <b>Identity Provider Name</b> field, enter a name for the authorization type, which is mandatory.
<img src="../images/identity-provider.png" alt="identity provider" title="identity provider" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;"></li>
<li>Provide the values for the mandatory authorization fields. For details, refer to the <a href="#define-authorization-fields" target="_blank">Define Authorization Fields</a> section. 

If the mandatory fields are left blank, validation error messages appear, as shown below.

</div>
    
<ol start="7"><li>(Optional step to be executed only when you select <b><i>OAuth V2</i></b> as the Authorization type) Click <b>+ Add Authorization Field</b> to add additional auth fields to your profile.

## Add Additional Field

These fields are used to collect additional authorization details from end users and allow you to incorporate extra security measures, such as a PIN code, device ID, or other parameters, alongside the standard credentials for *OAuth V2*. By customizing the authorization input fields, you can enhance security and align the authorization process with your specific business or compliance needs.


To add additional fields, follow the steps below:

1. Click **+ Add Additional Field** in the **New Authorization Mechanism** window and enter one or more key-value pairs.

## Authorization Profile Summary

Each authorization you add to your account is displayed in the **Authorization Profile** window with the following options:

* **Name**: The name you provide to the Auth profile you create.
* **Authorization Type**: The method/type set for the Auth Profile. Currently, only **oauth v2** is available.
* **Test auth**: Click the **Test** button corresponding to a configured profile to check if it establishes a connection with an external service based on the configured profile.
* **Status**: Displays **Configured** or **Not Configured** based on the configuration status.
    
<img src="../images/auth-profile-summary.png" alt="auth profile summary" title="auth profile summary" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">  

## Test the Auth Profile

The **Test** button is enabled when you provide all the fields in the **New authorization mechanism** window. To validate the connection using the configured mechanism, click **Test**.

A new window appears where AI for Process tries to establish a connection with the external service through the configured auth profile.

A successful connection is shown below:

<img src="../images/successful-oauth-connection.png" alt="successful connection" title="successful connection" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:50%;">  

If the connection fails, edit the auth profile with the correct information and test the connection again.
