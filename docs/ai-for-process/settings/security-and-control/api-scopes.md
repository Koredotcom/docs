# Manage Scopes and Keys for API Apps

AI for Process introduces **API scopes** in the **Settings** console, moving from unrestricted management API keys to more secure, scoped API key-based application management.

Users can select specific scopes for managing workflows, models, and guardrails. This allows for the creation of internal applications with restricted access to only the necessary API endpoints. By limiting API access, this feature reduces security risks, allowing administrators to generate multiple API keys and ensure secure, controlled access for authorized personnel.

**Important Considerations for API Keys**

* **Scope-restricted access**: API keys grant access exclusively to their assigned scopes.
* **Unauthorized access**: Any attempt to access unassigned scopes is automatically rejected.
* **Multiple keys per app**: You can generate multiple API keys for a single app.
* **One key per app**: An API key cannot be shared across multiple apps.
* **Immutable keys**: API keys can be deleted, but cannot be modified after they are created.
* **Copy-once policy**: For security reasons, each API key can only be copied once.

Users can rename an app, modify its selected scopes, or delete the app as needed. Once the admin defines or updates the API scopes, the changes are applied platform-wide, ensuring consistent and controlled access to the APIs wherever they are used. 

For more information on roles and permissions for API-scoped apps, please refer [here](../user-management/role-management.md#module-wise-permissions-and-access-levels){:target="_blank"}.


## Use Case: Scoped API Access for Banking Departments

A bank automates workflows and integrates various internal systems across different departments, including **Risk & Compliance**, **Customer Support**, and **Marketing**. This requires access to APIs with different scopes.

* **Risk & Compliance Department**: This team requires access only to models and workflows for generating reports from transaction logs and audit trails. The admin creates a scoped app that grants access to workflows and models. This prevents the team from accidentally accessing unrelated customer information available for guardrails. 

* **Customer Support Department**: Support agents require access to monitoring AI customer interactions, but should not have access to risk and compliance workflows or model management. A scoped app ensures support teams stay within their operational boundaries.

By using API-scoped apps and API keys, the bank minimizes the risk of data exposure while maintaining security, ensuring compliance, and strictly regulating access to authorized system users.

## Implement API Scoping

The key steps to implement API scoping include:

1. [Create an API app and assign scopes](../security-and-control/api-scopes.md#create-an-api-application){:target="_blank"}: API-scoped apps have limited and specific permissions tied only to the API endpoints they need. Creating an API-scoped app enables you to restrict permissions, enhance security, better control and monitor access, and tailor the app specifically to meet the integration’s needs.
2. [Create one or more API Keys to access the app](../security-and-control/api-scopes.md#create-an-api-key){:target="_blank"}: API keys for scoped apps provide secure, manageable, and auditable access control tailored to the app’s needs, making access and usage safer and easier to track.


### Create an API Application

To create an app, follow the steps below:

1. [Access](../security-and-control/api-scopes.md#access-api-scopes){:target="_blank"} **API Scopes**.
2. Click **Create an API App** or **Create an App**.
   <img src="../images/create-an-api-app.png" alt="create api app" title="create api app" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">
