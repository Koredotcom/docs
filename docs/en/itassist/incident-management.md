# Incident Management

Incident management involves the steps to identify, analyze, and resolve issues that the employees are not able to resolve on their own using the self-serve process and hence, require incidents to be created. Incidents are tickets that the employees create to get an issue resolved. 

IT Assist’s unified ticket management enables employees to create and manage the ticketing process end to end like creating new tickets, updating existing tickets, escalating tickets, or notifying employees about the status of the tickets. If there are any notifications related to incidents sent by the backend application, IT Assist is capable of displaying those notifications to the employees.

## Create Incident Tickets

IT Assist allows employees to easily create tickets in the backend application if they are unable to resolve the tickets on their own. For example, if an employee wants information about an application and IT Assist does not find any relevant information or the employee does not find the information useful, it prompts the employee to create an incident related to it.

Different backend ticket management applications require employees to provide various inputs about an issue like its priority, description, etc. IT Assist is capable of automatically converting the ticket creation forms in the backend applications to relevant questions for the employee as chat conversations and appropriately sending the employee responses back to the application. For example, if a backend application requires the employee to enter a description and urgency for the ticket, IT Assist will ask for those fields as questions to the employee in the conversation and return corresponding responses to the backend application.
