IT Assist intends to simplify the ways in which the employees can interact with the service desk. IT Assist is designed such that it can easily integrate with a vast array of communication channels, backend applications, and knowledge base systems using a service mapper tool. The service mapper tool provides out-of-the-box templates for commonly used applications.
