# Knowledge Search

With the focus on employee experience and the self-service strategy, enterprises set up knowledge bases to help their employees find the information to their queries on their own. However, multiple channels and the vast amount of information reduces the chances of finding the right information at the right time and thereby, reduce the usability of the knowledge bases to their full potential. Knowledge search in IT Assist allows accessing articles, guides, and/or blogs relevant to a particular topic or issue that the employee is searching for, without having to use different search engines and through their commonly used channel of communication. IT Assist is capable of understanding unstructured intents, interpreting them, and giving a structured response using knowledge bases, FAQ modules, and information from other integrated third-party applications.

In contrast to a basic knowledge base search, IT Assist is trained to interpret employee questions in a multitude of different ways and thereby return correct answers. It provides a featured snippet from the article along with a link to the complete article. 

IT Assist can search relevant information from various sources:

- **Enterprise’s Knowledge bases**: IT Assist enables easy and seamless integration with one or more enterprise’s knowledge bases providing just the right resource to the employees in response to their queries, alleviating service agents, and empowering the employees.
- **Pre-built ontology**: It can also search through the generalized FAQs and answers prepared for widely used enterprise applications like Slack, Outlook, etc. For more details, refer [FAQ Modules](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O_NP0HgupKwLae216EHm5madwR-Xk2dO/edit#bookmark=id.v73gh996460q) section below. This ontology also includes pre-trained general questions pertaining to basic services in the company like networking, intranet, VPN, printing, etc. 
- **System of Record**: It can skim through the articles in the knowledge bases of the backend system of record application integrated with IT Assist. 
- **Third-Party Applications**: IT Assist can also be configured to search through other third-party applications like confluence, google drive, etc. 

If IT Assist finds a relevant article in response to an employee query, it displays a featured snippet from the article along with a link to the complete article.
