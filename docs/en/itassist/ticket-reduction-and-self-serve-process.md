# Ticket Reduction and Self-Serve Process 

One of the top priorities for every service desk is to reduce the number of incoming tickets. When the number of tickets is high, it strains the support team agents leading to delays in working on critical issues and a poor employee experience. 

IT Assist offers a self-service process for the employees to interact in the most natural way and find what they need without having to wait for any support team agent. IT Assist provides information to resolve issues that are already resolved or announced by the service desk and allows employees to perform basic operations on their own. 

For example, if an application is not working for an employee, IT Assist can help identify if it is a known issue or an outage already announced for the application and avoid the employee contacting the service desk to get this information or raise a ticket.
