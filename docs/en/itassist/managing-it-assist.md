# Managing IT Assist

Every organization has its own set of requirements ranging from how the assistant responds to employee queries, the actions it can take independently, the applications it can be integrated with, etc. IT Assist is very flexible and can be optimized according to your organization's needs. You can manage, personalize, customize, analyze or extend the capabilities of IT Assist using a fully functional content management platform known as **Solution Workbench**. The main functions of Workbench include: 

- Managing and monitoring the solution end to end 
- Branding the IT Assist tool
- Customizing the look and feel
- Enabling, disabling, and customizing out-of-box features 
- Creating and adding new features 
- Managing the users
- Custom integrations with backend system of records

## Workbench Highlights

Workbench manages the assistant from personalization to testing and deployment. On a high level, an IT Assist admin can perform the following tasks using Workbench.
