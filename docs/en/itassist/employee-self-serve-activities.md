- **Application Health Checks**: IT Assist can interact with different applications to check the status of their health and provide related information to the employees. This information helps employees understand the behavior and performance of the application at the moment. Out of the box, it performs health checks for Slack and GitHub. It can be easily integrated with any other third-party application that provides the APIs to do the same.
- **Knowledge Base and FAQ Search**: IT Assist can search through a wide array of knowledge bases and systems of record allowing employees to get access to a variety of information. It can be integrated with various third-party applications like ServiceNow, Confluence, Google Drive, etc. to fetch relevant information for the employees from those applications. For more information, refer to [Knowledge Search](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O_NP0HgupKwLae216EHm5madwR-Xk2dO/edit#bookmark=id.q820drbeovuz).
- **Company announcements and Outage Information**: IT Assist can search through the recent announcements and outage reports generated by the service desk to keep the employees informed. This can cause a significant reduction in the number of redundant tickets. For details, see [Outage Reports.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O_NP0HgupKwLae216EHm5madwR-Xk2dO/edit#bookmark=id.gw8qdqzpr10)
- **Creating Incident and Request Tickets**: IT Assist not only enables employees to create tickets on their own but also initiates relevant workflows in the backend systems for ticket resolution. For more information, see [Incident Management](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O_NP0HgupKwLae216EHm5madwR-Xk2dO/edit#bookmark=id.rhrhmstplo8j) and [Request Management](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O_NP0HgupKwLae216EHm5madwR-Xk2dO/edit#bookmark=id.5yqbx9r9j0vf). 

## Configuration

You can integrate IT Assist to work with different knowledge base systems and customize the IT Assist behavior using the [Solution Workbench](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O_NP0HgupKwLae216EHm5madwR-Xk2dO/edit#heading=h.padn9r1w3g5k). As an admin, you can also enable or disable employees to perform various tasks on their own like managing accounts, viewing outages, creating tickets, etc. You can also add frequently asked questions as per your employee’s needs and behavioral patterns.
