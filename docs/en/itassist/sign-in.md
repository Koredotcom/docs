IT Assist provides omnichannel support. Once the administrators integrate IT Assist with the preferred channel of communication for the organization, employees do not need any special login or account to use the assistant. Employees can instantly access IT Assist using their credentials from single sign-on solutions like Okta or Azure AD. For example, if it is integrated with Slack, whenever an employee logs in to Slack, IT Assist will be accessible to the employee. Alternatively, it can also be integrated with any Identity Management solution that you are using or use the authentication mechanism of the System of Record that it is integrated with.
