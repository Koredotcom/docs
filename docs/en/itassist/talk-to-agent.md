# Talk to Agent

IT Assist provides a lot of self-help and ticketing features. However, there can be times when the employee issue is too complex for the virtual assistant or it is something critical and needs immediate attention. For such situations, IT Assist provides a simple interface to connect to live agents from the service team. The conversation is handed over from the virtual assistant to a live agent **seamlessly** and **contextually** using an Agent Desktop present in the system of record, such as SNOW, SAP, Salesforce, etc.

â€‹																			*Connecting to live agent*

This feature can be used whenever the employee is not able to find relevant information in response to his query or when there is something that requires the immediate attention of a live agent. The assistant also initiates this intent in case of fallback when the assistant cannot interpret the user messages repeatedly. In all these cases, the assistant acts as a proxy between the employee and the live agent desktop integrated with IT Assist.

## Configuration

The agent transfer feature in IT Assist can be enabled or disabled using the [Workbench](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O_NP0HgupKwLae216EHm5madwR-Xk2dO/edit#heading=h.gz8hbns3ppwx). An admin can modify the conversational flow and modify the communication channel with the agent. For integration with live agent software, refer to [this guide](https://developer.kore.ai/docs/bots/how-tos/how-to-configure-agent-transfer/).
