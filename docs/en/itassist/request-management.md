IT Assist helps employees search through the catalogs to request products or services on their own. IT Assist also initiates any workflows defined in the backend System of Record associated with the process for request management.

## Request Management Features

- Based on the employee’s request messages, IT Assist finds relevant items and lists them to the user. For example, if a user is looking for a laptop, IT Assist will search through the catalog items and list all the options of laptops available in the list. It also supports pagination and adds a scroll bar to display a long list of items.

- The backend applications usually require the employees to fill in forms with more details about the request. IT Assist automatically converts those fields of the request forms in the backend application into relevant questions for the employees to answer in the chat. The responses are then used to prefill the request form and raise the request.

- If there are any changes to the product or service catalogs, IT Assist can handle the changes seamlessly. 
- IT Assist triggers the workflows of the item request process defined in the backend application. For example, if an item request requires one or more approvers, IT Assist will send appropriate notifications to the approvers for the request.
