# Manager Approvals

Some IT tasks require the approval of the manager before an employee’s request is fulfilled. This additional step can introduce delay and lag in processing the employee’s request if the request goes unnoticed by the manager. To reduce the delay introduced due to this process, IT Assist provides a feature for managers and supervisors to view any requests waiting for an action from them. It is a two-fold feature where IT Assist sends a notification to the manager in real-time when the corresponding workflow is triggered (say, an item is requested by the employee), and the managers can also choose to view the list of requests waiting for an action from them.

The manager can then take appropriate action on the requests. This expedites the whole process considerably and completes the requests without having the manager to log into different applications.
