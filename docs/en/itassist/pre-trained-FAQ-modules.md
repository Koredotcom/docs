IT Assist includes a pre-trained ontology with generic answers to questions related to commonly used enterprise applications like Slack, MS Teams, etc.

Currently, IT Assist supports the following applications in the pre-built ontology. 

- Zoom
- Outlook
- MS Teams
- Slack
- SharePoint
- OneDrive

The ontology also includes pre-trained general questions about an organization’s networking and other widely used external services, such as VPN, printing, and intranet, which can reach into multiple knowledge bases.

The FAQ Modules are built as **knowledge graphs** enabling IT Assist to perform **efficient searches**. It also makes IT Assist understand **unstructured inputs** easily and be more efficient with **indirect queries**.

​																			*Knowledge Graph*

The FAQ modules enable IT Assist to have more knowledge out of the box. It can be used as it is or can be modified as per an organization’s needs and uses. For example, if a company has specific security or access policies for taking some actions in an application, the FAQs can be modified to provide precise information about the application instead of providing generic information about the application.
