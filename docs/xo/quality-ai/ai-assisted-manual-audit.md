Uses a weighted scoring algorithm that prioritizes final customer sentiment to better predict satisfaction and retention.

* Similarity ≥ threshold (Adhered)

* Similarity < threshold (Not Adhered)

* Trigger not detected ( N/A)

Example: 

* Each question is tied to a similarity threshold (for example, 60%).

* If an agent's response is greater than 60%, it is marked as adhered with full weight based on the number of questions (100%).

* Below the threshold = Not Adhered (0 weight).

* Questions marked Not Applicable are ignored in scoring.

#### Conversation Insights

This uses AI to give supervisors quick overviews of customer interactions by summarizing key events, outcomes, and important details without reviewing full transcripts or recordings. 

* **Customer Talk Ratio**: Percentage of total call duration customer is speaking.

* **Agent Talk Ratio**: Percentage of total call duration agent is speaking.

* **Silence Percentage**: Call time where neither party speaks (excludes hold time).

* **Speaking Rate**: Agent's speech speed (Words Per Minute - WPM calculation).

   This enables agents to view and navigate through message-level comments, which is available to all users, regardless of QA access permissions. This ensures that agents can benefit from comments added by QAs or Supervisors for learning and improvement.

**Review Near-Miss Scenarios (deterministic adherence)**

Near‑miss evaluations use predefined similarity thresholds to flag responses or utterances that closely resemble, but do not fully meet, adherence standards. Auditors review these “near‑miss” cases: situations where an agent’s performance was almost at the expected level but did not fully meet.

**How Near-Miss Works:**

* Evaluated only in Deterministic Adherence mode. 

* System uses predefined similarity thresholds to flag potential near-misses.

* When the **View** button is clicked:

    * The evaluation is marked **Yes** (highlighted in green).

    * The corresponding customer response is highlighted with the relevant context.

The system selects **By Question** metrics by default and prevents you from deselecting them. This default metric evaluates agent behavior question-by-question.    
<img src="../ai-assist-manual-edit/images/view-button.png" alt="View Chat" title="View Chat" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

!!! note

    * Auditors can only audit the selected types. 
            
    * Supervisor score calculation includes all enabled metric types.

**Audit Submission Process**

By default, this option is disabled unless the interaction is assigned for audit through Audit Allocations. Once the Supervisor or Auditor clicks **Submit**, the Supervisor’s responses for the interaction’s evaluations are recorded, and the audit score is computed based on the Supervisor’s responses.

This comprehensive audit panel facilitates efficient evaluation and ensures thorough review of each interaction.

!!! note

    * Submit button is enabled only for interactions assigned to the user.

    * You must answer all the question metrics before submission.

When the evaluation form includes all the required metrics in the **Audit** page, the **Submit** button is enabled to complete and submit the audit.

    1. The audited Interactions become unavailable for reassignment by other users on the **Interactions** page. 

    2. Once an interaction is fully evaluated and submitted, you cannot re-audit.

    3. Only the Interactions that are not assigned to others or already audited are available.

**Agent Scored Interactions**

Based on the **Agent Access to Scored Interactions** settings, the agents can view the following interaction types:

* **Only manually audited interactions**: Shows only **Supervisor Audit Score** interactions with Date & Time and Queues.

* **Manually audited and Auto QA scored interactions**: Shows **Kore Evaluation Score** (Auto QA), **Supervisor Audited Score** interactions, including Date & Time and Queues.

Each row lists a terminated interaction (by an agent), with columns:

* Date & Time

* Queues

* Auto QA Score (if Auto QA and manually audited interactions are accessible)

* Audit Score

* **Hide Auditor Details for Agent**

    * When toggled on, auditor details are anonymized in the audit screen. 

    * When toggled off, auditor details are visible in the audit screen.
      
    !!! note

        Only the supervisors can view the auditor details. The agents are restricted from viewing the auditor details.

**Evaluation Marking (Yes/No/N/A):** 

Auditors can check and review the following near-miss scenarios on the audit screen:

The form is evaluated based on the agent's performance and actions taken during a customer conversation. 

“Yes” is marked when:

* The agent clearly performed the required action.

* Evidence exists in the conversation/chat log.

* The requirement is fully met according to the standards specified.

* Example: Agent said, "Good morning, how can I help you?" → YES for greeting.

“No” is marked when:

* The agent failed to perform the required action.

* The action is taken, but not adequate (close to but not fully meeting the standard).

* Required information is not provided or incomplete.

* Example: Agent didn't ask for mobile number at all → NO.

“N/A” is marked when:

* The situation didn't arise or isn’t applicable. 

* The customer didn't request the specific information.

* The requirement couldn't be fulfilled due to circumstances.

* Example: When the customer never asked about interest rates → N/A for "Did agent inform interest rate values?"
