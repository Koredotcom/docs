## Conversation Mining - Interactions

This feature enables supervisors to review and filter scored interactions within their assigned queues, making it easier to identify conversations that need coaching or attention. It delivers clear insights into conversation quality, agent performance, and customer experience at the conversation level and agent level.

By using these new capabilities, supervisors can:  

* **Queue Interaction Review**: Access scored interactions within their assigned queues to identify conversations that need coaching or attention.

* **Gain Clear Quality Insights**: Understand conversation quality, agent performance, and customer experience at a glance.

* **Analyze Conversations with Insights**: Leverage integrated Taxonomy-based Topic Discovery, Topic-Level Sentiment, and Resolution insights to perform better analysis across Conversation Mining, the AI-Audit Screen, and Agent Dashboards.

* **Identify Key Conversation Insights**: Use taxonomy-based topics, topic-level sentiment, and resolution status across filters, columns, audits, and dashboards to identify unresolved or high-impact conversations and interpret sentiment with intuitive, color-coded indicators.

* **Filter by Experience Insights**: Apply new filters for configured intents (topics) across L1, L2, and L3 levels, generated intents, and overall resolution (resolved/unresolved).

* **Audit with Precision**: Customize the view with metadata and column controls, including the new configured intent column (showing topics with sentiment color-coding) and the overall resolution column.

* **Refine Searches Efficiently**: Use keyword-based filtering, including speaker-specific filters, include/exclude terms, and options to hide resolved or irrelevant cases.

* **Leverage Timeline Navigation**: Use a timeline-based search and jump-to-match display for fast, focused review.
Save Custom Views: Store preferred filter sets and column configurations for targeted, repeatable audits.

### Interactions Filters 

Interaction filters help you find specific conversations, review agent performance, and identify improvement opportunities. By using the following filters, auditors can dive deeper into conversations and assess agent adherence to quality standards. Filters update automatically based on the default language set.

#### Columns

You can filter the Columns in the Interactions's dashboard by including or excluding specific fields.

#### Bookmarks

Lets you assign interactions to bookmarks and view all bookmarks linked to an interaction.  

#### Date Range Selection

Provides the option to select the date range for the conversation interactions. The default date range selected is always the last seven days.  

!!! Note

    If you attempt to evaluate an interaction not assigned to you, you cannot submit the evaluation.

## Filters

This helps you to pinpoint high-value interactions, streamline audits, and narrow results to conversations that need attention. You can add filters from the Filters dropdown and refine results using multiple category panels.

## Add New Filter

The new filter interaction enables you to focus on areas of interest or those with high potential for improvement, where you can save them for audit assignments. It helps you filter out options and identify which interactions went wrong.

Steps to Add New Filter:

1. Select the **Filters** dropdown to add a new filter.   
<img src="../conversation-mining/images/Filters.png" alt="Filter" title="Filter" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">  

Steps to Add New Filter:

1. Select the **Filters** dropdown shown in the upper-right corner to add a new filter. 

2. Select the **+ Add New Filter**.   

3. Choose a **Filter By** category.   

## Filter Categories

This Filter categories panel lets you refine and analyze interaction data based on various parameters configured, such as efficiency, experience, behavior, and keywords.

### Filter by Efficiency

This provides an operational view of areas of interest where there is greater potential for improvement. 

To filter by Efficiency,

1. Select **Channels** (Chat or Voice) to limit interactions to a specific communication mode.

1. Select **Audit Status** to view Audited, Assigned, or Not Assigned conversations.

1. Enter the **Conversation ID** to filter by a specific interaction.

1. Enter the **Custom Conversation ID** to filter by a user-defined identifier.

1. From **Queues**, select the queue or routing group for the interaction.

1. From **Agent Groups**, select the group linked to the chosen queue. You can filter only groups associated with the selected queues.

1. From **Agents**, select the agent assigned to the chosen queue. The list shows only agents who have interactions in that queue.

1. Enable the required filter options: 

    * Filter by handling time
    * Filter by deviation from AHT
    * Deviation (%)
    * Number of Transfers

### Filter by Experience

This category captures the emotional and qualitative aspects of the customer journey.

#### Avg. Waiting Time

Select the required date range in seconds.

#### Sentiment Score

This indicates the positive sentiment score (higher) and negative sentiment score (lower) interactions. Provides a slider bar to move the minimum and maximum interaction range. 

#### CSAT
 
This shows the distribution of interactions across the score range in which the customer has responded to the feedback service, and is then drilled down accordingly.  
<img src="../conversation-mining/images/experience-csat.png" alt="CSAT" title="CSAT" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">  

#### Configured Intents

Select the configured topics or intents for each conversation across all levels (L1, L2, and L3) from the search bar. Child lists update automatically based on the parent level selection.

#### Generated Intents

Select the configured intents for each conversation, or choose AI-suggested options based on your input.

#### Overall Resolution

Filter conversations by Resolved or Unresolved (both selected by default). The system marks a conversation Resolved when it determines all applicable L3 intents, and Unresolved when it can't define at least one intent.

#### Churn Monitor

This provides the underlying cause and need that a conversation relates to. It indicates the loss of customers over a specific period.

This has the following two options to churn the monitor:

* **Churn Risk**

    Shows the level of customer churn risk in a conversation. Supervisors can view the churn risk percentage for a selected date range. 

    !!! Note

        The customer churn is calculated once per interaction. Customer churn is not calculated as a score. 

* **Escalation**

    This detects the number of escalations raised to the Supervisor by a customer.  

### Filter by Behavior

This category analyzes interaction dynamics and conduct between agents and customers. 

#### Metric Name

This filter enables supervisors to view interactions by specific evaluation metrics. Use radio buttons to filter by Pass or Failed and select a metric from the drop-down list to refine results.  

#### Metric Qualification

The selected evaluation metric appears as a tag under the input field, and you can clear it by selecting **X**. When you open the page from the Adherence Heatmap, the system automatically applies the filters. If you select queues, the list shows only metrics from the forms in those queues. The filter retrieves interactions where the metric applies, allowing you to view failed or adhered interactions using the radio buttons.

#### Language

Select the languages to add from the dropdown list.   

#### Empathy Score

This measures how well the agent understands and responds to the customer’s situation. It shows the extent of negative sentiment, such as frustration or displeasure, expressed by the customer. A higher score indicates a more empathetic interaction.

#### Crutch Word Score

This shows how often the agent uses filler words (for example, umm, uh, and similar terms). A higher score indicates greater use of these crutch words.  

#### Agent Playbook Adherence 

This shows the Agent AI playbook adherence percentage for that interaction.   

#### Kore Evaluation Score

This shows the automated QA score for an interaction, based on the evaluation form assigned to an interaction’s queue.
