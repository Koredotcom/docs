# Analytics for Bots Admin

The Analytics module provides the history of all administrative tasks with attributes such as **User Name**, **User Email** **Date/Time**, and **Description** for an event. You can review the **Audit Report** page to analyze admin users, custom admins, and user events such as log on, log off, and changes to system settings.

The following illustration shows an example of the **Analytics** module with the **Audit Report** page displayed.

<img src="../images/analytics-img1.png" alt="Analytics - Audit Reports" title="Analytics - Audit Reports" style="border: 1px solid gray;zoom:70%;"/>

## Viewing System and User Events

On the **Audit Report** page in the Kore.ai Bots Admin Console in the **Analytics** module, you can view the Kore.ai system and user-generated events. For example, a system-generated event could be a periodic Microsoft® Active Directory® Sync. An example of a user-generated event could be the addition of a new user.

Using the filters on the **Audit Report** page you can select event categories, events, and time periods to drill down and filter events as needed. Kore.ai audit reports also list error messages that can help you troubleshoot system issues or when you create a Kore.ai service request.

### Using the Search Field

The list of entries in an admin console table can be very large depending on the size of your company, for example, a list of users. To find one or more specific users or groups, in the **Search** field, enter at least three characters to begin find-as-you-type.

!!! Note

    The number of search terms in a search query is unlimited, however, no more than the first 20 characters of each search term is used to return search results.

To view all entries, clear the search field, and then press the **Enter** key.

### Filter Options

You can narrow the list of events by date range, user/app, category, and name.

**Date Filter** can be set to

* past 24 hours – default selection;
* past 7 days; or
* Custom range by selecting the start and end dates.

**Event Filter** can be set by clicking the Filters button and then setting:

* the **User Name/App Name** field to narrow the events triggered either by a specific user or by a specific app.
* the **Event Category** field to show **All** events or select a specific category from the drop-down list.
* Based on the **Event Category** field selected, you can choose **All** or a specific event by name in the **Event Name** filter.

### Export Options

* The **export** icon can be used to Export the audit reports in CSV format.

### Record Details

By clicking on any entry you get to view further details pertaining to below:

<img src="../images/analytics-img4.png" alt="Export search" title="Export search" style="border: 1px solid gray;zoom:70%;"/>


!!! Note

    The Audit Report contains system and user events for several Kore.ai products. To drill down further than Event Categories, use the Search for Description field, which lets you add one more criterion to the filter. To get XO Platform data, search for "Bot Builder" exactly; the Search field is case-sensitive. For more complex filtering, we recommend exporting the report and using a spreadsheet editor.

### Audit Report Details

The audit report is categorized by event category and event name. The following table lists these categories and a brief description as to what even qualifies against each category.

* **conversation types** can be either one or both of the following:
    * _interactive sessions_ – conversations that include one or more messages from the user.
    * _non-interactive sessions_ – conversations that do not include any message from the user.

### Chat History Details

Chat History provides visibility into the user information with the inclusion of the following functionality:

* **User Profile**: Provides a 360-degree view of the user along with their usage metrics;
* **User Conversation Sessions**: Lists out all the sessions of the user in the given period with the selected utterance section expanded.
* **Trace ID**: A unique ID assigned to each incoming message. The Id is also included in all the logs maintained by the Platform. To see the associated Trace ID for an incoming message, hover over the message, click the Info icon, and then click the Message Id to view the Trace ID. 

<img src="../images/analytics-img9.png" alt="Chat History details" title="Chat History details" style="border: 1px solid gray;zoom:70%;"/>

    ‘`Trace Id: Trace records for this message are not available`‘.
