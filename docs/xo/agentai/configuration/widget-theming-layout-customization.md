Note that the **Assist Home** menu has a limit of 12 characters, and the other menus have a limit of 10 characters only. Click **Reset** to return to the default menu name.

## Other Labels

You can disable this entire section by using the **toggle** button at the top and enable or disable either or both the labels (**Dialog Started** and **Dialog Ended**). In the following screenshot, **Dialog {{Task}} started** label has been renamed as **Dialog {{Task}} began**.

## Visibility Controls for Sent/Copied Messages

## Widget Menu Layout

This section lets you enable or disable the Agent AI widget menus - **Assist Home**, **Search**, **My AI Agent (Bot)**, and **Transcript** (for the Voice channel). The disabled menus appear on the widget, only if you enable them back. It also lets you select a landing tab and create a custom tab (**+ Add Custom Tab**). You can position the menus at the bottom or the side by clicking the **Bottom** or **Side** options at the top or shuffle the menus with the drag-and-drop action. To automatically position the menus based on the pixel level, select the **Responsive** option; If the pixel size is less than 600, the menus move to the bottom, and for more than 600, the menus move to the left. The following screenshot shows a disabled **Search** menu, **Side** positioning of the enabled menus, **My AI Agent (Bot)** tab marked as the landing tab, shuffled **Assist Home** menu with the **My AI Agent (Bot)** menu, and the **+ Add Custom Tab** button:

## Search Result Layout

This section lets you control how search results appear in the widget. You can use **Classic Search** (default) that shows only the current search results or **Conversational Search** to provide more contextual results.  

* **Classic Search (Default)**: Displays only the current search results. Each new search clears the previous query and results. When you select this option, the existing dialog tasks appear and once you enter a search query, the results replace the dialog tasks area. Refer to the following screenshot to view how the widget UI appears for this option:  
    <img src="../widget-theming-layout-customization/classic-search.png" alt="classic-search" title="classic-search" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">  

* **Conversational Search**: Displays a history of previous questions and answers. Agents can refer to earlier results and ask followup questions, reducing repetition and improving context.  

    !!! note

        Search history is maintained per agent at the conversation level. During agent transfers, the search history is cleared.  

    * When you select **Conversational Search**, the widget shows the **Library** and **Search** tabs. By default, the **Library** tab displays the existing dialog tasks. When you enter a query or select the **Search** tab, results appear under the **Search** tab, and previous searches remain visible. The following screenshot shows the search results in the **Conversational Search** option:  
        <img src="../widget-theming-layout-customization/conversational-search.png" alt="conversational-search" title="conversational-search" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

    <img src="../widget-theming-layout-customization/search-result-layout.png" alt="search-result-layout" title="search-result-layout" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">  

5. Select **Classic Search** or **Conversational Search**.
6. Select **Save**. 

## Assist Action Menu Layout

This section lets you enable, disable, and customize the placement of the action buttons in the Assist tab. You can use the toggles to enable or disable the buttons and the drag-and-drop action to shuffle their positions. The following screenshot shows all enabled action buttons:  
<img src="../widget-theming-layout-customization/assist-action-menu-layout.jpg" alt="widget-menu-layout" title="widget-menu-layout" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">
