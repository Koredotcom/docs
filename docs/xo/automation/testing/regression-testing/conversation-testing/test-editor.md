# Test Editor

You can use the Test Editor to view the test cases and their metadata. This section explains the steps to access the test editor and use the available options:

1. On the **Conversation Testing** page, click on any **Test Suite** to go to the **Test Editor**.

2. In the **Test Editor**, the platform shows the validated chat along with its metadata and assertions for each test case.

A  test case consists of: 

    * One user input  
    * One or more VA responses for a user input

4. If the VA response is from a dialog intent, the following details are displayed:  

    * Intent name  
    * Node name
	    * Error Prompt/User Prompt for Entity node. For more information, see [Entity Node](https://developer.kore.ai/docs/bots/bot-builder-tool/dialog-task/working-with-the-entity-node/#Component_Properties){:target="_blank"}.

    * Transitions
    * User Input  
    * Expected Output  
        * All the variations of the node prompt are added as expected output  
        * If a node has more than one variation, then the OneOf operator is added by default  
      
            !!! note
            
                The **OneOf** operator is used to test randomization scenarios where a node can have multiple bot responses. For any node in which multiple responses are configured, the operator is activated by default. If one of the multiple responses is obtained from the VA during the test execution, then the assertion will be passed.

5. If the VA response is from **FAQ/Small Talk/Standard Responses**, the following details are captured:  

    * Intent Name (FAQ Name, Small Talk Pattern, Standard Response)  
    * User Input  
    * Expected Output: It has the same details displayed as in Dialog Intent.  
    * Assertions  
        * Flow (Enabled by default)  
        * Text (Enabled by default)  
        * Context
