# Default Standard Responses

On the Platform, you can view the default Natural Language Processing or NLP interpreter responses to user inputs or events.

For example, a reply to a user input of *Hi!* The bot replies with one of the following responses, chosen randomly at runtime:

* Hi!
* Hello
* Hi there!
* Hey 🙂

The NLP interpreter displays pre-defined text responses to users based on an event, condition, trigger, or user input. Depending on your custom bot and the users of that bot, you may want to modify the default responses to users displayed for an event or request for input.

Example

* **User Input** – When were you born?
* **Event** – Authorization Failure
* **Trigger** – Task canceled

You can define both standard bot responses, or if desired, add a channel override response displayed only in the specified channel the user is in, otherwise, one of the standard default responses is displayed.

For example, in the SMS channel, you may only want to use short bot responses to save data.

## Standard Response

XO Platform provides a few default text responses. To access and manage the default responses on the Platform,

Go to **Automation AI** > **Virtual Assistant** >  **Conversation Intelligence** > **Conversation Management** > **Standard Responses**.

For each standard response category tab, the event or user input is listed, followed by one or more NLP interpreter standard responses.

You can modify the default response, and if needed, add additional responses selected randomly by the NLP interpreter in response to user input or system event.

In the **Standard Response** section, the standard bot responses are categorized in the following tabs:

### Statements

Responses are displayed to the user as the result of an action by the bot or user. For example, a user cancels a task, or a user gives an invalid response to your bot request.

    * In the bot **Response** editor, you can override the default Bot Response for this channel using basic editor controls on the **Simple Mode** tab, or write custom JavaScript for the response on the **Advanced Mode** tab as follows:
         * **Simple Mode** tab – Enter the text for the default standard response. For example, *There* you are, I was *hoping* you would return soon! and then optionally, format the text using the formatting buttons for bold, italics, header styles, hyperlinks, ordered and unordered lists, and inserting a line. For more information, refer to [Using the Prompt Editor](../../use-cases/dialogs/prompt-editor.md).
         * **Advanced Mode tab** – Enter JavaScript to override the channel message as described in the following code examples.
    * Click **Save** to save and close the **Edit Response** dialog and apply the new standard response.
