### Summarization in Spanish

### Error Message Configuration

The error message display pattern in the Agent AI widget has been updated to help agents view and understand issues without unnecessary redundancy.

You can configure error messages during [Use Case creation](https://docs.kore.ai/agentassist/use-cases/dialogues-creation/){:target="_blank"} at the bot level. These messages are displayed in the Agent AI widget for invalid user input. The runtime display varies based on whether a single or multiple error messages are triggered.

**Single Error Message**

When a single error message is triggered during dialog task execution, the **Assist** tab displays the error message and the number of occurrences. If the same error message is triggered again, the message does not repeat, but the number of occurrences increases.

### Enhanced Scroll Functionality in the Widget

In the Agent AI widget, the **Assist** and the **My Bot** tabs now contain “up” and “down” arrow buttons at the top and the bottom to let you scroll to the first and last messages. These buttons appear after the messages in the **Assist** tab are large enough to require a scroll bar.

### Agent AI Enabled Dialog Tasks for Playbook Step Adherence and Triggers

### Feedback Reason and Comment on Summarization

The Agent AI widget's Summary feature now offers enhanced feedback capabilities for auto-generated summaries. Agents can provide more specific and actionable feedback by selecting a reason from up to five customizable messages and adding optional comments. Administrators can edit these messages, turn the comment box on or off, and choose the feedback language. This improved feedback system allows agents to pinpoint issues with summaries more accurately, contributing to the continuous improvement of the auto-summarization feature's accuracy and relevance over time.

### Language-specific Summarization

The Agent AI widget now supports language-specific summarization for third-party agent desktops. Admins can customize the language of automatically generated conversation summaries by selecting the **Custom Dialog Task** option in the **Auto Summarization Model** section. After choosing a preferred language, the system displays a configured dialog task for that language. The summary is then generated based on this language-specific task, allowing for more accurate and culturally appropriate summaries across different languages.  
<img src="../images/language-specific-summarization-4.png" alt="language-specific-summarization" title="language-specific-summarization" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

### View Summary from Any Active Tab

The Agent AI widget now displays summaries more flexibly across all active tabs. When an agent closes a conversation, the summary appears on whichever tab they're currently viewing, not just the Assist tab. This change supports the widget's customizable layout feature, allowing agents to see summaries even if they've rearranged or removed certain tabs. For example, a summary can now pop up on the Search tab, enhancing the widget's versatility and ensuring agents always have access to important conversation summaries regardless of their current view.

### Widget Layout Customization (Beta)

The Agent AI widget now offers channel-specific layout customization in beta. Users can adjust language settings, menu labels, visibility controls for messages, dialog task timelines, and assist message types. The feature also allows customization of widget menu layout, assist action menu, landing tab settings, and "More" menu behavior. This flexibility enables tailoring the widget to specific channel needs and preferences. While the preview function is still in beta and may not fully reflect the final widget experience, it provides a close reference for customization options.

<img src="../images/conversation-logs.png" alt="conversation-logs" title="conversation-logs" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

* For easy identification and comparison, the modified Conversation Summary before submission is marked as “Edited Summary” with an “eye” icon to view the original summary.  
<img src="../images/edited-summary.png" alt="edited-summary" title="edited-summary" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

### Enabling Channel-Specific Automations and Managing Appearance in the Widget Library

Agent AI lets you configure channel-specific dialog tasks across all communication channels - Chat, Voice, and Email. You can also specify whether these dialog tasks appear in the list or only when searched in the widget’s library (**Search** tab). These preferences can be set while creating or editing a dialog task and are available under the **Triggers & Permissions** tab.
<img src="../images/triggers-and-permissions.png" alt="triggers-and-permissions" title="free text" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

**When Enabled**: When a dialog task is enabled for a specific channel, it is triggered automatically or manually by the agent during interaction with customers on that specific channel.

**Launch Through Library**: 

**Enabled**: The dialog task is listed under all available dialog tasks in the **Search** tab of triggers-and-permissions widget.

**Disabled**: The dialog task doesn’t appear on the list but remains searchable via the “Ask a question” search bar in the **Search** tab.

## v11.2 June 01, 2024

<u>Patch Release</u>

This update includes feature enhancements and bug fixes. Key features and enhancements included in this release are summarized below.

### Auto-scroll Agent AI Widget Content

The **Auto-Scroll Assist Tab Content toggle** lets you manage the scrolling functionality of content in the Assist tab. Agents can enable/disable this toggle in the **AgentAssist widget** > **Settings** tab.

### Entity-Based Summarization

Dialog tasks having “message nodes” didn’t let users customize the Conversation Summary. Hence, to let users customize the Conversation Summary, “message nodes” are replaced with “entity nodes”. To utilize this capability, admins must create dialog tasks with entity nodes and select these dialog tasks in the **Agent AI** > **Configuration** > **Widget Settings** > **AgentAssist Channel Specific Settings** > **Auto Summarization** > **Auto Summarization Model** > **Custom Dialog Task** section.

<img src="../images/entity-based-summarization-2.png" alt="entity-based-summarization" title="entity-based-summarization" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

For Conversation Summary customization, select a dialog task with “entity node” in the **Custom Dialog Task** field.

### Warm Transfer

Agent AI has introduced the **Warm Transfer** feature to customize the transfer functionality of the Agent AI widget. This feature specifically caters to third-party configurations, where appropriate transfer events are transmitted.

The **Warm Transfer** feature can be defined as a conference call between two agents and applies to both Voice and Chat channels. During this process, Agent-2 has the ability to modify the Summary Feedback, but the **Run**, **Override, Send, Copy, Terminate, Restart,** and **List View** buttons remain disabled until Agent-1 disconnects from the call. It has the following options to choose from:

* **Scroll up to the First Message**

* **Continue from the Last Message**

* **Configure Dialog Task**

### Negative Feedback Settings

For better processing and accurate identification of reasons for receiving a “thumbs down”, Admins can now configure a list of negative feedback messages for agents to select. They can also include a comment box for agents to add additional comments. Admins decide whether these two options appear in the widget after agents select the “thumbs down” icon at the end of a Dialog Task and after each answer and FAQ. Additionally, Admins can change the language of the feedback messages by selecting one from the available language list.

This is applicable only to third-party agent desktops.

After enabling the **Auto Summarization** toggle, select one of the following options:

* **OOTB Kore Summarization**: For Kore’s default auto summarization
* **Custom Dialog Task**: To generate customized auto summarization, you must select a dialog task with a single message node. These message nodes call APIs.

#### Enhanced Agent Feedback Functionality

The AgentAI dashboard has been updated to include a detailed summary of Agent Feedback for dialog tasks, including "Not Helpful" feedback and additional comments. Users can now get a detailed view of the “Not Helpful” feedback with Responses, Additional Comments, and Counts.
