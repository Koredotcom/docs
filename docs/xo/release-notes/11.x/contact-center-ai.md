### Kore Voice Gateway

#### Changes to Bot Delay Handling

These updates refine how delays are managed during bot interactions, enhancing the user experience by providing smoother transitions.

If a delay persists between two message nodes:

* In the case of a URL, the music stops immediately when the bot responds.
* In the case of a text message, the prompt plays completely, even after the bot responds.

Example: If a bot has the following nodes - Message → API → Message nodes.

* Waiting music starts playing when there is a delay from the API node.
* When the API node responds, the music stops gracefully, and the next message node begins playback without interruption.

### API

#### Conversation History API

#### Task Name (tN) Field Added in the Response for Automation Bots

The response of the Conversation History API is updated to show the “tN” field for all intents executed in Automation bots. This field accurately shows the task name associated with the executed intent. For example, “tN” = “Pay Bill”, “tN” = “Show Balance”. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../apis/automation/conversation-history.md)

* Outbound Campaigns: Agents can handle calls from Auto Dialers. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../user-management/manage-users.md#chat--voice)

#### Progressive Dialer

The Progressive Dialer is an outbound calling system that improves agent efficiency and productivity. It automatically dials the next number in a queue as agents complete their current calls, ensuring continuous activity. Calls are connected only when a human answers, filtering out voicemails and busy signals. Agents can review contextual information about the contact beforehand but have limited control over the timing or recipient of calls. The dialer optimizes lead allocation based on agent availability, tracks statuses to assign calls to the least busy agent, and provides comprehensive metrics and call statistics for monitoring and reporting purposes.

## v11.2.1 June 15, 2024

<u>Patch Release</u>

This update includes feature enhancements and bug fixes. Key features and enhancements included in this release are summarized below.

### Configuration

#### Revised Routing Logic When No Agents Available

When no agents are logged in, conversations will now remain in the queue until the maximum wait time specified for that queue is reached. After the queue timeout occurs, the "no agents available" flow will be automatically triggered.

This enhanced routing logic is enabled by default at the account level for all new accounts and applies across all channels. It ensures that when agents are unavailable, conversations are handled smoothly by the fallback flow after the configured wait time, improving the customer experience.
