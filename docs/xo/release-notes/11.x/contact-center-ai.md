<u>Patch Release</u>

This update includes enhancements and bug fixes. The key enhancements included in this release are summarized below.

<font size="4">Console</font>

**Enable Virtual Backgrounds for Agent Video Calls**

Agents can now apply, change, or remove virtual backgrounds during live video calls without interrupting the session. The feature supports predefined static and blur backgrounds, provides an in-call preview and selection UI, and works across all supported browsers and devices. Virtual backgrounds affect only the agent’s video stream, helping maintain brand consistency, protect privacy, and ensure a professional customer experience with no impact on call quality. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../console/interacting-with-customers.md#apply-or-change-a-virtual-background-during-a-video-call)

**Agent-to-Customer Screen Sharing during Video Calls**

Agents can securely share a selected browser tab or application with customers during live audio or video calls to guide and resolve issues faster. The feature supports in-session start/stop controls, enforces encryption and audit logging, and automatically ends sharing when the call ends. The system controls access through a new Agent Screen Share permission and supports all compatible browsers without impacting call quality. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../console/interacting-with-customers.md#agent-to-customer-screen-sharing)

<font size="4">Configuration</font>

**Editable System Agent Status Labels**

Administrators can rename system-provided statuses such as Available, Away, and Busy to match internal terminology without affecting system behavior. Custom labels are supported in English, Korean, Chinese, Japanese, and German, with fallback to default names when translations are missing. Updated labels appear consistently across the Console, dashboards, and reports. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../contactcenter/agent-and-supervisors/agent-management/agent-management.md#edit-an-agent-status)

**Priority-Based Queue Routing**

Contact Center AI supports an optional priority-based queue routing model that allows administrators to assign priority levels to queues. When enabled, agents assigned to multiple queues receive conversations from the highest-priority queue first, while maintaining FIFO order within each queue. Controlled by a system-level setting, defaults to existing routing behavior when disabled, and applies changes immediately without impacting active assignments or routing eligibility rules. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../contactcenter/configurations/settings/queue-level-settings.md)

**Route Queued Conversations to Out of Business Hours Flow**

An optional system setting now routes queued conversations to the Out of Business Hours (OOBH) flow when OOBH is triggered. When enabled, queued interactions are routed to the configured OOBH flow, while agent-waiting interactions honor the existing wait time. The default behavior remains unchanged when disabled. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../contactcenter/configurations/settings/queue-level-settings.md)

**Agent Utils Support for Dynamic Waiting Experience**

Flows now support a new Agent Utils function (`setWaitingExperience`) that lets developers to override the waiting experience at runtime dynamically. The most recently applied waiting experience takes precedence, enabling flows to override skill-based or earlier configurations without duplicating queues or logic. If an invalid waiting experience is provided, the system gracefully falls back to the default behavior without affecting the interaction. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../flows/node-types/utils.md#set-waiting-experience)

<font size="4">Campaigns</font>

**API Integration: Contact List Schema Change Handling**

When an API Integration contact list schema change affects linked campaigns, the system replaces existing columns and displays a warning listing the affected campaigns. Campaign filters are now read-only while a campaign is active, preventing changes during execution. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../contactcenter/campaigns/list-management/list-management.md#api-integration)

**Campaign Dispositions: Map Positive Outcomes**

Campaign creation now lets users to mark specific dispositions as Positive Final Outcomes from the Dispositions tab. These selections persist and used in campaign scoring to produce more accurate, meaningful conversion metrics in analytics. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../contactcenter/campaigns/campaign-management/voice-campaigns.md#dispositions)

**Redirect Agents to Console for Preview and Progressive Voice Campaigns**

For Preview and Progressive Voice Campaigns, when a call initiates while the allocated agent isn't logged in to the console, the system displays a notification dialog. It automatically redirects the agent to the console after 5 seconds. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../contactcenter/campaigns/campaign-management/voice-campaigns.md#redirect-agents-to-console)

## v11.21.0 January 17, 2026

<u>Minor Release</u>

This update includes enhancements and bug fixes. The key enhancements included in this release are summarized below.

<font size="4">Console</font>

**Agent Status Time Insights in the Console**

The Agent Console now provides Status Insights under Agent Status to display aggregated time spent across system and custom statuses, including conversational status. Agents can view day-level insights in a pop-up and access detailed breakdowns in My Dashboard. This improves visibility into work patterns without impacting the current agent status. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../console/manage-layout.md#agent-status)

**Standard Response Widget: Replace and Append Support**

The Standard Response Widget supports Replace and Append actions to align with shortcut-based insertion. Agents can overwrite existing content or append multiple standard responses while preserving formatting and variables. For email, agents can optionally include or ignore the subject when replacing or appending, with subject options shown only when supported. When the editor is empty, only the Copy option appears, and focus returns to the editor after each action. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../console/interacting-with-customers.md#emails)

**Queue-Level Consult Without Mandatory Agent Selection**

Agents can now initiate a consult by selecting only a queue, without choosing a specific agent. The system routes the consult to an available agent using existing routing logic, improving speed and usability. Direct agent selection remains supported with no impact to current routing, reporting, or monitoring behavior. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../console/interacting-with-customers.md#queue-level-consult-without-selecting-an-agent)

**Courtesy Callback Redial Updates**

Courtesy callback redial now displays clear guidance for agents and supervisors. When the maximum number of redial attempts is reached, a Close Conversation option appears, directing the agent to the disposition screen. Supervisors attempting to assign such calls see a message: _“Maximum redial attempts reached for this number.”_ After the first or second failed attempt, the text updates to indicate the attempt failure while still allowing the agent to redial or return the call to the queue.

<font size="4">Configuration</font>

**Agent Status Grouping by Queues and Operations**

Agents can now belong to multiple agent groups, and each group can be associated with a relevant set of custom agent statuses. Status visibility dynamically adjusts based on group membership, reducing clutter and improving operational clarity. All updates are applied in real-time across agent profiles and consoles, without impacting existing workflows. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../contactcenter/agent-and-supervisors/agent-management/agent-management.md#create-an-agent-group)

**Named-Agent Transfer Wait Before Queue Fallback**

The system can hold a named-agent transfer for a configurable duration before routing it to the queue. If any named agent becomes available and accepts within the wait period, the conversation is assigned to that agent; otherwise, it falls back to existing queue routing. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../flows/node-types/utils.md#set-named-agents)

**Parent–Child Permission Dependency Management**

This update enforces parent–child permission dependencies across the Agent Console and Monitor Tab, automatically disabling child permissions when the parent is set to No/View and restoring them when re-enabled.

It also resolves an earlier issue with Transfer/Close Multiple Conversations by splitting it into three granular permissions: Assign Conversations, Change Queue, and Force Close Conversations (individual or multiple). These permissions inherit their values from the parent setting, and administrators can review and update them to Yes or No as needed. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../user-management/role-management.md#permissions)

**Alerts for Extended After Call Work**

This feature enables SLA-based alerts for After Call Work (ACW) by allowing admins to configure threshold conditions at the queue and channel level. When an agent’s ACW duration meets the configured condition, the system triggers a General Alert and notifies configured recipients via in-app notifications and/or email, including relevant details. The alert setup is fully configurable and doesn't affect existing ACW behavior when disabled. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../contactcenter/performance-management/slas-and-alerts.md#create-a-general-alert)

<font size="4">Campaigns</font>

**Power Dialer for Voice Campaigns**

The new Power Dialer mode dynamically selects and dials contacts based on agent availability and pacing ratios to reduce call abandonment. The feature intelligently prioritizes contacts and reserves agents during dialing to ensure an immediate connection. New global settings permit configurable control over agent linking and idle time, improving campaign efficiency. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../contactcenter/campaigns/campaign-management/voice-campaigns.md#power-dialer)

**Per-campaign Dispositions vs Attempts Dashboard Table**

Provides a campaign-level view that correlates outbound attempts with their final dispositions. This enables campaign managers to assess how attempts progress and where outcomes converge as campaigns near completion. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../contactcenter/campaigns/dashboard/campaign-dashboard.md#disposition)

**Disposition-based Retry Configuration for Campaigns**

Added a disposition-level retry configuration for Preview, Progressive, and Power Dialer campaigns, allowing campaign managers to define retry eligibility, retry count, and retry intervals per disposition. Campaign dashboards also display current disposition counts to provide visibility into retry outcomes during or after execution. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../contactcenter/campaigns/campaign-management/voice-campaigns.md#dispositions)

**Automatic Enrollment of Unreachable Contacts into Global DNC**

An app-level control automatically enrolls phone numbers into the Global DNC list when repeated call attempts fail. The capability supports configurable attempt thresholds and retention periods, ensuring cleaner contact lists and reduced unnecessary dialing while preserving existing behavior by default. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../contactcenter/campaigns/settings/global-settings.md#unanswered-call-attempts)

The feedback appears contextually alongside CSAT information for improved review and insights. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../analytics/overview/conversations.md#insights-to-logs)

**Error Event Visibility for Real-time Voice APIs in Agentic Apps**

Error events from real-time voice APIs are now captured and displayed in Interaction Details when a response generation failure occurs. The transcript timeline shows a clear LLM error indicator with a timestamp, along with the full provider error message for improved troubleshooting and audit visibility. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../analytics/overview/conversations.md#insights-to-logs)

**Voice Interaction Latency Metrics**

The Conversations → Insights to Logs → Transcriptions tab now displays latency metrics for Voice interactions to help evaluate responsiveness. Customer messages show ASR latency, while bot messages show Bot, TTS, and End-to-End latency (only when a bot message follows a customer message). Unavailable values display as NA, and the entire latency block appears only for the Voice channel. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../analytics/overview/conversations.md#insights-to-logs)

<font size="4">API</font>

**Schedule Campaign API for Voice and SMS**

A new ScheduleCampaign API enables scheduling for Voice and SMS campaigns. The API permits enabling or disabling scheduling for a campaign and overrides any existing schedule when enabled. It supports UTC-based start and end times with Daily or Weekly recurrence options, while returning a standard status and message response. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../apis/contact-center/enable-voice-or-sms-campaign-schedule-daily.md)

**Contact Management APIs: Create, Update, and Delete**

The platform now supports a complete set of Contact Management APIs, including Create (existing), Update, and Delete operations. These APIs enable external systems to keep contact data synchronized, support partial updates, and permit safe deletion without impacting historical interactions.

[Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../flows/node-types/connect-to-api.md#general-settings)

<font size="4">Campaigns</font>

**Campaign Suppression Behavior**

The system now reevaluates suppressed campaigns as soon as the suppression condition expires. Campaigns become eligible again when cool downs end, active chats close, or conflicting campaign templates no longer apply. Because this is an event-driven process, the system reconsiders a suppressed campaign for display only when a new event triggers evaluation. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../contactcenter/campaigns/campaign-management/proactive-web-campaigns.md#campaign-suppression-and-re-evaluation)

**Global and Campaign-Specific DNCs Now Mandatory**

The platform now enforces the use of both Global and Campaign-specific Do Not Call (DNC) lists to ensure compliance and consistent campaign management. A default Global DNC list is automatically created for new accounts or when Campaigns are enabled. Only one Global DNC can exist at a time, and selecting a DNC list is now mandatory during Voice Campaign creation. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../contactcenter/campaigns/list-management/list-management.md#dnc-lists)

**Handling of DNCs - Global and Non-Global**

Global DNC (GDL) lists automatically apply to all Voice Campaigns, followed by Campaign DNC (CDL) lists. Voice Campaigns use both GDL and CDL for contact filtering, while SMS and Proactive campaigns rely only on their respective DNC lists. Changes to Global DNCs don't impact active or paused campaigns, ensuring campaign stability. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../contactcenter/campaigns/list-management/list-management.md#handling-of-dncs-global-and-non-global)

Minimizing or closing the widget returns it to its original size and position, improving accessibility and efficiency without altering supervisor-configured layouts. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../console/manage-layout.md#maximize-external-widgets)

**Email Resend Capability**

Agents and supervisors can resend emails directly from the Console. The “Resend” button opens the email composer with the original content and recipient prefilled, allowing edits to the message body or attachments before sending. Resent emails retain formatting and references, are sent as new interactions, and are linked to the original email in the timeline for audit and traceability, improving efficiency and communication accuracy. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../console/interacting-with-customers.md#emails)

<font size="4">Configuration</font>

**Conditional Group Routing (CGR)**

Conditional Group Routing (CGR) dynamically expands the pool of agents across queues to optimize utilization and reduce customer wait times. Administrators can configure rule-based sharing of agents between queues within the same division, using KPIs such as Estimated Wait Time (EWT) and Average Handle Time (AHT), combined with real-time agent availability. The system evaluates rules sequentially and in real-time, incrementally adjusting the agent pool, enforcing wait periods, and optimizing assignments to maintain service levels. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../contactcenter/routing/queues/queue-management.md#queue-routing-modes)

**Honor Agent Wait Time Before Queue Timeout**

A new toggle in **Agent Settings** → **Answer Mode** ensures conversations honor the full agent wait timeout before applying the queue wait timeout. When enabled, the queue timeout pauses while the conversation waits for agent acceptance, preventing premature closures. By default, the toggle is disabled for backward compatibility. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../contactcenter/agent-and-supervisors/agent-management/agent-management.md#honor-agent-wait-before-queue-timeout)

**Remove Chats When Disconnected in Queue and Control Interruption Messages**

Administrators can now configure separate timers for customer interruptions: one for chats in queue (default: 30 seconds) and another for after the agent accepts the call. Disconnected chats while in the queue are removed from the agent tray based on the configured queue timer. Disconnected chats after an agent has handled them remain in the agent tray for the duration set under Customer Interruption after agent transfer. Interruption messages for customers and agents can be enabled, disabled, or customized as needed. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../contactcenter/agent-and-supervisors/agent-management/agent-management.md#conversation-statuses-by-channel-live-chat-messaging-and-voice)

**SLA Configuration UI Revamp**

The SLA configuration screen now opens as an inline overlay for consistency with other configuration screens, allowing users to add, edit, and delete SLAs while retaining all existing functionality and validations. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../contactcenter/performance-management/slas-and-alerts.md)

**Removal of Inbound Option from User Attributes**

The Inbound option in **User Attributes** → **Enable Voice** has been removed as inbound voice calls are always enabled for all users. Its removal simplifies the configuration experience, with no impact on existing functionality. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../user-management/manage-users.md#chat-voice)

<font size="4">Campaigns</font>

**Voice Campaigns: Support for Experience Flows Without Phone Numbers**

Voice campaigns can now be associated with experience flows that don't include phone numbers, extending support to agentless, progressive, and preview campaigns. The Caller ID dropdown lists all eligible outbound-only and inbound-outbound numbers, regardless of flow association. For active, scheduled, or paused campaigns, linked numbers and flows can't be deleted. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../contactcenter/campaigns/campaign-management/voice-campaigns.md)

<font size="4">Analytics</font>

**Change Logs for Contact Center AI**

The Contact Center AI logs are now integrated into the Change Logs under **App Settings** → **App Profile**. All CCAI log entries generated after the cutoff date are stored in this new repository and displayed in the proper format, including the app name. The Admin Console’s Audit Log will no longer capture CCAI activity after the cutoff date; older entries remain accessible there for reference. This ensures a clear separation between Admin Console operations and Contact Center AI change tracking. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../app-settings/change-logs.md)

**Latency Report (Beta)**

The Latency Report provides visibility into ASR, Bot, TTS, and end-to-end delays at node and call levels. Users can generate latency data for specific calls by enabling the relevant call control parameters, and only these calls will offer the option to download the Latency Report. Administrators can apply threshold-based filters to identify calls that exceed defined latency values. The report is available in CSV format, with key fields including Session ID, Agent, Queue, CSAT, and latency metrics. A new option in the Interactions page allows downloading a component-wise latency report for detailed analysis of delays. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../analytics/contact-center/reports/latency-report.md)

**Debug Log for Flows**

Contact Center AI nodes now support debug logging within the Flow Builder, extending the existing debug log functionality. Users can view detailed, real-time logs for each step in a flow, including timestamps, step names, input/output data, error messages, and context variables, similar to those found in automation nodes. Logs cover triggers, node execution, task assignments, notifications, digital forms, human tasks, actions taken, and flow completion. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../contactcenter/flows-and-routing/debugging-and-troubleshooting.md)

**Bulk Transfer and End of Calls, Chats, and Emails in Agent Queues**

App Owner, Administrators, Supervisors, and App Developers can bulk transfer or end multiple conversations across chat, email, and voice channels directly from the Monitor tab. Users can select a queue, view active conversations, and perform multi-selection to transfer conversations to another queue or end them with a confirmation. This update streamlines workload management, improves operational flexibility, and reduces manual effort in handling agent queues. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../console/monitor-queues-agents-and-interactions.md#transfer-conversations-to-a-queue)

<font size="4">API</font>

**Secure Forms and PII Data Access Using GetMessagesV2 API**

The GetMessagesV2 API has been enhanced to support secure access to form data. In the GET method, a new query parameter `includeSecureForm` is included, and in the POST method, a new field `includeSecureForm` is included in the request body. When enabled, both options include the form inputs submitted by users in the response, extending access to secure form and PII data. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../apis/automation/conversation-history.md)

**Campaign Creation API: Support for SIP Numbers as Caller ID**

The Campaign Creation API now supports using pre-registered SIP numbers as Caller ID across all dialing modes. This enhancement expands flexibility in configuring Caller ID for campaigns, allowing SIP phone numbers to be set in addition to existing options.

## v11.17.0 August 23, 2025

<u>Minor Release</u>

This update includes enhancements and bug fixes. The key enhancements included in this release are summarized below.

<font size="4">Console</font>

**Translation Support for Historical Digital Conversations**

The Chat History Tab now supports translation for past digital interactions, using the same controls and settings as the Live Agent Console. This update enables agents, supervisors, and auditors to review multilingual conversations without the need for external tools, ensures consistent UI behavior, and prevents redundant translation calls. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../console/additional-tools.md#translate-historical-digital-conversations)

**Email Arrival Summarization, AI Content Disclaimer, and Fallback Message**

Email interactions now include arrival summaries with intent, sentiment, queue details, and wait time, bringing feature parity with other channels. All LLM-generated summaries display the disclaimer “_AI-generated content - verify before using_” to ensure transparency. When summarization is disabled or fails, the system shows the fallback message “_Summarization is disabled_.” Existing summarization workflows in other channels remain unaffected. This enhancement improves agent context, supports compliance, and provides clear user feedback. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../console/interacting-with-customers.md#emails)

**Improved New Message Handling in Agent Console**

The agent console no longer auto scrolls when new user messages arrive, preventing disruption during conversation review. Instead, a floating “New Messages” option appears if the agent has scrolled up. Selecting the option scrolls to the latest message, after which the option disappears. This update enhances usability, preserves reading context, and grants agents complete control over when to view new messages. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../console/interacting-with-customers.md#viewing-new-messages-in-the-console)

**GenAI-Based Disposition Prediction for Agent Wrap-Up**

Contact Center Agents now receive AI-generated disposition code suggestions at the end of conversations. Using LLM analysis of the full transcript and disposition set metadata, the system recommends the most relevant wrap-up code, which displays in the disposition bar with options to accept it with one click or override it manually. This improves accuracy and reduces wrap-up time. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../console/interacting-with-customers.md#intelligent-disposition-code-suggestions)  
<img src="../images/wrap-up-code-release-notes.png" alt="Agent Wrap-up Code" title="Agent Wrap-up Code" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">

<font size="4">Configuration</font>

**Automatic Away Status for Agent Inactivity**

Administrators can configure the system to automatically set an agent’s status to Away when the _Agent Inactivity Wait Time_ is breached after a conversation becomes overdue. When enabled, the system updates the agent’s status to 'Away', prevents the agent from receiving new interactions, displays the updated status in the Supervisor dashboard, and applies existing routing rules for the 'Away' status. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../contactcenter/configurations/settings/automatic-away-status-for-agent-inactivity.md)  
<img src="../images/automatic-away-release-notes.png" alt="Automatic Away" title="Automatic Away" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">

**Configurable CSAT Survey Trigger for Agent-Closed Conversations**

A new toggle, _Trigger CSAT only for agent-closed conversations_, is now available in CSAT survey settings. When enabled, surveys are sent only when a conversation is manually closed by an agent, excluding closures due to inactivity, queue timeouts, or user disconnections. This update improves CSAT accuracy by reducing unnecessary survey triggers. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../contactcenter/configurations/surveys/configure-surveys.md#chat-call-and-email-experience) 

**Support for Special Characters in Agent customId**

The customId field now supports all special characters except spaces and backslashes, resolving previous errors during creation or updates. The character limit is 64, with validation applied consistently across the Admin Console, APIs, and backend services. This enhancement improves routing flexibility and operational mapping without affecting existing records, metrics, permissions, APIs, or Dynamic Routing. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../user-management/manage-users.md#general-settings)

**Revised Channel Attachment Rules for Default Welcome Flows**

Administrators can no longer attach channels to the Default Welcome Voice flow or Default Welcome Chat flow. Channels already attached to these flows will continue to function as configured. However, if a channel is reattached to a different flow, it can't be reattached to a Default Welcome Voice flow or Default Welcome Chat flow. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../channels/voice-gateway/configure-voice-gateway.md#attach-a-flow) 

**HTML/CSS Email Templates for Response Templates and Surveys**

A Code View option is now available in the email message editor for Response Templates and Survey Forms. Users can paste or write HTML/CSS code, switch between rich text and source views without losing content, and preview the final design before sending. This enhancement enables the creation of structured, branded, and reusable email templates, ensuring consistent formatting across senders and recipients. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../contactcenter/configurations/response-templates/manage-response-templates.md#create-a-response) 

<font size="4">Web SDK</font>

**Click-to-Call Capability for Web SDK Using Experience Flow Configuration**

The Web SDK now supports a Click-to-Call option, enabling website visitors to start voice calls directly from the UI. Calls route through configured flows, share assistant transcripts with human agents, and support recording, transcription, and ACW. The button is disabled by default and can be configured using the theme editor. Sessions log separately in the dashboard and can be initiated before, during, or after bot/chat interactions. In live chat, the agent receives a closure notice and is redirected to ACW. Multiple SDK configurations and flexible deployment methods (npm, script tag, source modification) are supported. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../console/interacting-with-customers.md#inbound-click-to-call-interaction) 

<font size="4">Analytics</font>

**Transcripts Log Updates for Maximum Retry Handling**

The transcripts log now displays timeline messages when maximum retries are exceeded and the configured fallback action is triggered. Instead of appearing as user transcription messages, the log indicates the scenario. For example, when a No Input timeout is exceeded and a fallback action is triggered, the message “Max no-input attempts reached” is shown. This update helps app users easily understand the reason behind the triggered action. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../analytics/overview/conversations.md#insights-to-logs) 

<font size="4">API</font>

**Fetch Conversation Details by Session ID**

A new Public API is available to fetch conversation details using the Parent App Session ID. The API returns conversation details only when a successful agent handoff has occurred in the session. If no handoff exists, it returns the error: “Conversation not found for the given session id.” [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../apis/contact-center/get-conversation-details.md)

Access to manage these engine settings is restricted to authorized users. This support offers increased flexibility, improved compatibility, and enterprise-level control over multilingual interactions. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../contactcenter/configurations/settings/translation-configurations.md) 

<font size="4">Campaigns</font>

**Cooldown Time for Proactive Web Campaigns**

Proactive Web Campaigns now support a configurable Cooldown Time, allowing users to control how often widgets display to a visitor within a single session. The setting defaults to 0 minutes and caps at 30000 minutes. During cooldown, no other widget appears, even if rules are met, though visitor activity continues to be tracked. The update also adds a "Greater Than or Equal To" operator for the Page Visit Count rule. Only one widget displays at a time, ensuring a clean user experience. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../contactcenter/campaigns/settings/global-settings.md#proactive-cooldown-time)

[Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../sdk/sdk-events.md#onevent)

<font size="4">Console</font>

**Improved Channel Identification with Distinct Interaction Icons**

Introduced distinct icons for each interaction type—including inbound voice calls, callback requests, voicemails, emails, and chats—to enhance visual clarity and reduce agent confusion. Tooltips with localized labels appear on hover to support quick identification. These icons now appear consistently across the conversation tray, monitor tabs, and dashboard views. This update enables agents to prioritize real-time interactions, enhances supervisor visibility into queues, and aligns the visual design with enterprise workflows. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../console/conversation-tray.md#incoming-conversation-types)

**Auto-Prefill Country Code for External Consult Calls**

The external consult call dialer now pre-fills the country code based on the agent’s last completed consult call, reducing manual input and speeding up outbound call setup. If no previous call exists, the field defaults to system settings or remains editable. Agents can override the pre-filled value before dialing, ensuring flexibility and minimizing call errors due to manual entry.

**Reply All Functionality Added to Email Channel**

The email interaction panel now includes the "Reply All" option alongside the existing "Reply" option. Agents can review and modify recipients before sending the message. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../console/interacting-with-customers.md#emails)

<font size="4">Configuration</font>

**Control Supervisor Join/Exit Notifications**

Added a new system setting that allows administrators to disable supervisor join and exit notifications shown to end users during live conversations. This functionality is enabled by default, displaying messages when a supervisor joins or exits a chat. To disable the notifications, administrators can turn off the toggle. The setting takes effect in real time, persists across sessions, and is recorded in the audit logs for traceability. This update supports silent supervision and helps meet compliance or customer-specific requirements.

**Queue-Based Filtering for Response Templates**

Added a new "Queue Match" toggle to the response group configuration settings, allowing administrators to control the visibility of standard responses based on the interaction queue. When enabled, responses in the group are shown only to agents handling conversations from selected queues. This setting works in combination with existing Skill Match and Agent Group Match filters, ensuring response templates appear only when all configured conditions are met. The feature enhances contextual relevance, improves agent efficiency, and helps enforce queue-specific communication standards. All updates take effect immediately and are recorded in audit logs. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../contactcenter/configurations/response-templates/manage-response-templates.md#create-a-response-group)

**Voicemail Notification in General Alerts**

The General Alerts system now includes voicemail-specific alerts to notify supervisors when unattended voicemail counts exceed defined thresholds or remain unresolved beyond a set duration. Admins can configure alerts per queue, define count and time thresholds, and select notification types such as toaster or email. Supervisors receive timely notifications to manage backlogs and uphold SLAs. All voicemail alerts are logged, auditable, and scalable for future expansion. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../contactcenter/performance-management/slas-and-alerts.md#create-a-general-alert)

<font size="4">Campaigns</font>

**Support for Custom Object Fields in Proactive Web Campaign Rules**

These updates apply across the Interactions dashboard (list, detail, export), Reports (Detail and Segment), and APIs (Conversation List, Details, and Export). This ensures consistent reporting and visibility across all outbound call types. 

<font size="4">API</font>

**Start and Stop Campaigns**

This API enables users to programmatically start or stop campaigns using `either CampaignName` or `CampaignID`, with either the `Run` or `Stop` action. The API requires `AccountID` and `AppID` in the URL and returns the execution instance ID on success. Enables automation of campaign execution via backend scripts. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../apis/contact-center/api-list.md#campaign-management-apis)

**Campaign Status and Results**

This API enables users to retrieve the execution status (`active`, `paused`, `stopped`, or `completed`) or detailed result data for completed or stopped campaigns using account, app, campaign, and execution IDs. The results include per-contact data such as `phoneNumber`, `DialerOutcome`, `BotOutboundStatus`, and agent disposition codes. Supports automated campaign lifecycle tracking via background scripts. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../apis/contact-center/api-list.md#campaign-status)

**Add and Retrieve Contacts in Contact Lists**

These APIs enable the management of contacts in Contact Lists programmatically.

* The `POST` API allows adding up to 100 contacts per call using `ContactListID`, supporting mapped and unmapped fields.
* The `GET` API retrieves all contacts with pagination support (`skip`, `offset`, `hasMore`). Duplicate handling follows the list’s append-and-duplicate configuration, which is fixed at creation.  
[Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../apis/contact-center/api-list.md#contact-list-management)

**Create, Retrieve, and Delete Campaigns**

Introduced APIs for complete Campaign lifecycle management. These APIs can be used to:

* Create campaigns by specifying configuration such as channel, flow name, contact list, DNC list, priority, caller ID, and retry logic.
* Retrieve all stored properties of a campaign using its Campaign ID.
* Remove a campaign using its Campaign ID. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../apis/contact-center/api-list.md#campaign-management-apis)

These APIs support both Agentless Voice and SMS (Simple/Advanced) campaign types. Campaigns created via API remain fully accessible and manageable through the UI.

**Contact List Management with "API-Passive" Type**

Added support for managing Contact Lists via public APIs, including a new type: `"API-Passive"`. These APIs can be used to:

* Create a contact list by specifying `Contact List Name`, `Type`, and `DuplicateCheck`.
* Retrieve all metadata for contact lists (excluding contact data).
* Delete a contact list along with all its contacts. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../apis/contact-center/api-list.md#contact-list-management)

These APIs enable users to automate contact list creation and management without requiring the use of the UI.

**Outbound Calling API Enhancements – AMD Parameters and Notify URL Headers**

The Outbound Calling API has been enhanced to improve AMD handling and support custom headers for external integrations.

* AMD Parameter Support: All AMD detection variables (`amd_human_detected`, `amd_machine_detected`, `amd_tone_detected`, etc.) are now available in both the context object and notify URL payload for use in Bot Builder.
* Greeting Message in Context: The detected greeting message is now passed in the context for use in bot flows.
* `greetingCompletionTimeoutMs` Handling: The timeout now functions correctly, preventing message cutoffs after `amd_machine_detected`.
* Custom Notify URL Headers: The Dialout API now supports custom headers in the notify URL, enabling customers to receive enriched event data.

This update includes enhancements and bug fixes. The key enhancement included in this release is summarized below.

<font size="4">Configuration</font>

**Disabling Contact Center Permissions**

Supervisors and admins with full user management access can now disable contact center permissions for users without deleting their accounts. This action:

* Prevents users from handling interactions or changing their status.
* Keeps all account data intact.
* Marks users with a "disabled" tag in user management and search results.
* Excludes users from active lists and assignments.

When supervisors attempt to add disabled users to a list, the system displays the "disabled" tag. Analytics data remains unchanged, but excludes information from users who are disabled. Once a user is disabled or deleted, they are removed from the agent node and all related configurations.

## v11.14.0 May 31, 2025

<u> Minor Release </u>

This update includes enhancements and bug fixes. The key enhancements included in this release are summarized below.

<font size="4">Agent Console</font>

**Manual PII Redaction**

Agents can quickly redact or mask sensitive data, minimizing the risk of storing or exposing PII and aiding compliance with data privacy regulations. Role-based permissions enable supervisors to control access to redaction, ensuring that only authorized users can perform these actions. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../console/interacting-with-customers.md#manual-pii-redaction)

**Supervisor Support Request**

Agents can now directly request supervisor support from their console during a conversation, providing context and clarity. These requests can be sent to specific supervisors or groups (all or skill-based). Only logged-in and available supervisors will be notified and see the support message in their internal chat. Permissions govern agents' ability to send requests and supervisors' ability to receive notifications, enabling adaptable support management. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../console/interacting-with-customers.md#request-supervisor-support)

**Disable ‘Assign’ Button for Supervisors During Call Connection Stage**

The ‘Assign’ button is now disabled for supervisors when a call is in the connecting stage between the agent and the customer. If a supervisor attempts to click ‘Assign’ during this stage or when the connection fails due to negative scenarios, an error message appears, preventing reassignment. This update ensures that supervisors cannot prematurely reassign calls, thereby avoiding issues such as a blank console for the already connected agent.

<font size="4">Configuration</font>

**Identification of Returning Customers Within 24 Hours**

A new context variable, `isReturn24h`, is now available. This variable is automatically set to ‘true’ if a user contacts the center within 24 hours of their previous interaction.

**Queue Load** = (Voice + Chat/3 + Messaging/8 + Email/10) x 100 / Available Agents

Where

Voice = Voice Count; Ongoing or waiting in queue (including Voicemails or Callbacks before turning Outbound).  
Chat = Chat Count; Live chat conversations ongoing or waiting in a queue.  
Messaging = MessagingCount; Messaging conversations ongoing or waiting in a queue.  
Email = Email Count; Email conversations ongoing or waiting in a queue.

## v11.3.1 July 13, 2024

<u> Patch Release </u>

Key features and enhancements included in this release are summarized below.

<font size="4">Agent Console</font>

**Enhanced Outbound Calling**

Agents can now make outbound calls from any status except "System Away" (Chat and Voice) and "System Busy" (Voice). This feature allows agents to contact customers at scheduled times or during emergencies without changing to "Available" status, preventing incoming calls.  

Key Points:  

* Outbound calls are possible while handling digital interactions.  

* No secondary outbound calls until the current voice call ends.  

* Agent status automatically changes to "System Busy" when initiating an outbound call.

## v11.3.0 June 29, 2024

<u> Patch Release </u>

Key features and enhancements included in this release are summarized below.

<font size="4">Agent Console</font>

**Enhanced Outbound Dialer**

The outbound dialer has been enhanced with the following functionalities:

* **Search Bar**: The search bar on the dialer interface allows agents to enter keywords or partial numbers to find configured contacts quickly.
* **International Subscriber Dialing (ISD) Code Update**: The dialer automatically adjusts the outbound phone number's ISD code based on the last country code used. This streamlines the process for agents making calls to different regions.
* **Phone Number Formatting**: The system displays the phone number in a standardized format when an agent enters it for dialing, regardless of whether the original number contains hyphens or brackets if the format is valid.
* **Validation and Error Handling**: An error message is displayed if an invalid number is entered (for example, incorrect length or characters). The call button is disabled until a valid number is entered, preventing accidental calls to inaccurate numbers. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../console/interacting-with-customers.md#outbound-dialer)

**Improved Conversation Handling With an Explicit Reject Button**

Administrators can enable agents to explicitly reject an incoming interaction, allowing them to manage their workload efficiently. If Explicit Reject is enabled in the Answer Mode:

* Agents can Accept (✅) or Reject (❌) each interaction on the conversation tray.
* **Accept**: Displays the conversation panel for that interaction.
* **Reject**: Removes the interaction from the agent's queue and returns it to the queue for reassignment. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../console/managing-incoming-interactions.md#manual-answer-mode)

The Monitor tab displays metrics relevant to rejection in the Agents and Interactions sub-tabs.

Monitor > Agents

* The Agents sub-tab now includes counts for rejected and unanswered interactions.
* Clicking an agent displays the count of Completed, Transferred, Rejected, and Unanswered interactions. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../console/monitor-queues-agents-and-interactions.md#agents)

Monitor > Interactions

* Clicking an agent displays the count of Answered, Transferred, Rejected, and Unanswered interactions. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../console/monitor-queues-agents-and-interactions.md#manually-assign-conversations-to-an-agent-and-change-queue)

<font size="4">Configuration</font>

**Phone Number Labels for Outbound Dialer**

Administrators can now label outbound phone numbers (for example, Technical Support, Helpdesk). These labels appear next to phone numbers on the outbound dialer. Agents can search numbers by label, with results updating dynamically. The system logs all label-related activities, including creation, modification, and deletion.

<font size="4">Administration</font>

**PII Redaction: Consistency Between Instance and Automation Bots**

To ensure consistency, the instance bot also redacts data that the Automation bot redacts and vice versa. This applies to all channels. This change affects new transcripts created from this release onwards. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../app-settings/advanced-settings/pii-data-masking.md)

<font size="4">Analytics and Reporting</font>

**Queue Metrics Interval Report**

This report provides queue performance metrics at sub-daily intervals (15 minutes to 4 hours). It includes service level data, highlighting both met and unmet targets. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../analytics/contact-center/reports/queue-metrics-interval-report.md)

**Secure Form View Extended to 30 Days**

Administrators and Supervisors with access to Dashboard > Interactions can now view the data captured via the Secure Forms for up to 30 days from the conversation date.

**Auto Refresh of Monitor Tab Filters**

Automatic refresh for filters applied in the Monitor tabs at fixed intervals is implemented to ensure real-time data accuracy.

* Filtered data on Monitor tabs is updated at the specified interval, reflecting real-time changes.
* New interactions are not immediately added to filtered results but appear after the 5-second update interval.

<font size="4">Voice Gateway</font>

**Changes to Bot Delay Handling**

These updates refine how delays are managed during bot interactions, enhancing the user experience by providing smoother transitions.

If a delay persists between two message nodes:

* In the case of a URL, the music stops immediately when the bot responds.
* In the case of a text message, the prompt plays completely, even after the bot responds.

Example: If a bot has the following nodes - Message → API → Message nodes.

* Waiting music starts playing when there is a delay from the API node.
* When the API node responds, the music stops gracefully, and the next message node begins playback without interruption.

<font size="4">API</font>

**Task Name (tN) Field Added in the Response for Automation Bots**

The response of the Conversation History API is updated to show the “tN” field for all intents executed in Automation bots. This field accurately shows the task name associated with the executed intent. For example, “tN” = “Pay Bill”, “tN” = “Show Balance”. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../apis/automation/conversation-history.md)

<font size="4">Campaigns</font>

**Cloning Campaigns Without Schedule Configurations**

When a campaign is cloned, the new campaign will not include the schedule configurations of the parent campaign. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../contactcenter/campaigns/campaign-management/voice-campaigns.md#clone-a-voice-campaign)

**Voice Campaigns: User Settings for Auto Dialers**

Administrators can enable voice support for inbound calls and outbound campaigns.

* Inbound: In the case of an Agentless Dialer, the agent can handle transferred calls.
* Outbound Campaigns: Agents can handle calls from Auto Dialers. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../user-management/manage-users.md#)

**Progressive Dialer**

The Progressive Dialer is an outbound calling system that improves agent efficiency and productivity. It automatically dials the next number in a queue as agents complete their current calls, ensuring continuous activity. Calls are connected only when a human answers, filtering out voicemails and busy signals. Agents can review contextual information about the contact beforehand but have limited control over the timing or recipient of calls. The dialer optimizes lead allocation based on agent availability, tracks statuses to assign calls to the least busy agent, and provides comprehensive metrics and call statistics for monitoring and reporting purposes. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../contactcenter/campaigns/campaign-management/voice-campaigns.md)

## v11.2.1 June 15, 2024

<u>Patch Release</u>

This update includes feature enhancements and bug fixes. Key features and enhancements included in this release are summarized below.

<font size="4">Configuration</font>

**Revised Routing Logic When No Agents Available**

When no agents are logged in, conversations will now remain in the queue until the maximum wait time specified for that queue is reached. After the queue timeout occurs, the "no agents available" flow will be automatically triggered.

This enhanced routing logic is enabled by default at the account level for all new accounts and applies across all channels. It ensures that when agents are unavailable, conversations are handled smoothly by the fallback flow after the configured wait time, improving the customer experience.

Existing accounts will continue to use their current routing logic. To take advantage of this improved routing, please contact Support to modify your configuration. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../console/interacting-with-customers.md#behavior-when-no-agents-are-available)

<font size="4">Voice Gateway</font>

**Improved Sorting and Enhanced Auto Accept**

By default, new conversations will appear at the top of the conversation tray based on their order of acceptance. Agents can choose to revise the sorting order, placing the latest conversation at the top or bottom.

When a new auto-accepted conversation arrives in the agent's conversation tray, a **New** indicator is displayed beside it. When anyone applies a conversation filter that hides incoming auto-accepted conversations (for example, ongoing, idle), a preview of the auto-accepted conversations appears with a "View" button next to each hidden conversation to allow quick view and access. The indicator and the view option remain till the agent clicks the conversation and sends the first message. [Learn more :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../console/managing-incoming-interactions.md#handling-incoming-interactions-based-on-answer-mode)
