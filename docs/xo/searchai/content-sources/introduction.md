# Introduction

Business organizations use multiple sources to store diverse information and data. These sources include the company website, blogs, help centers, user guides, product catalogs, and sometimes, third-party knowledge bases. For instance, a company typically showcases its products and services on its website, accompanied by detailed information in the help center. Frequently, terms and conditions associated with these offerings can be found in PDF files or as FAQs on the website. Locating specific information can be a tedious task for the users. Kore Bot Builder streamlines this by facilitating the ingestion of different types of data from different sources, making it easier to find relevant answers from the comprehensive data set.

Search AI application offers a versatile solution for data ingestion. You can ingest data from a wide range of sources using the following methods. 

* [**Web Crawl**](./web-crawl.md): Extract and index content from websites. 
* [**Directories**](./directory.md): Index data from files in various formats like PDF, docx, ppt, etc.
* [**Connectors**](./connectors.md): Extract data from third-party applications like ServiceNow, Confluence, etc.

In the **Content** section of SearchAI, you can easily manage your data sources. Here, you can add or update any content source, with different content sources listed under different pages for easy navigation.

Whenever content from a source is ingested into the Search AI application, **automatic training** is initiated for the newly ingested content. This creates the answer index in the application corresponding to the ingested content using the configured extraction strategies.
