# JSON Connector

JSON Connector enables the ingestion of chunked content directly into the SearchAI application. This content is immediately added to the indexed content, ensuring seamless integration and efficient data retrieval within SearchAI. This gives the users the flexibility to ingest any type of data to the application by creating structured data from it in a given format. 

The content can be added to the application as one or more files containing chunked content in JSON format. Each file should have an array of JSON objects where each object corresponds to a chunk. Hence, it is mandatory that the keys of the object exactly match the chunk fields in the application. 

## File Format

The structured content can be uploaded to the application using a JSON file.

Currently, the structured content in the JSON file is expected to be in a specific format for the Search AI application to understand. Key things to remember:

* The name of the file is used as the recordTitle. 
* The JSON file structure is expected to be an array of objects where each object presents the details of a chunk. 
* The chunk fields are expected to match the fields listed below.

Refer to the sample file for reference. 

## Configuration Steps

Go to the **Connectors page** under **Content**. Add the **JSON Connector**. 

![Home](./images/json/home.png "Home")


Select the source name to which the JSON content is to be uploaded. If there is no existing source, create a new source. Upload the file with the structured data in JSON format. Use the sample file as a reference for the JSON file format. 

![Configure](./images/json/configure.png "Configure")

Click **Proceed**. This will ingest content from the files into the application. Click on the **Files** tab to view the contents of the connector at any time. 

![Files](./images/json/files.png "Files")

To add more content to the connector, add JSON Connector again,** select the same source name** as before, and add more files. 

![Add Files](./images/json/add-files.png "Add Files")

Things to note:

* You can upload up to 10 files at a time, where each file should not exceed 15MB in size. 
* The name of the file used to upload JSON content is used as the recordTitle.
