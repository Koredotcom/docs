To integrate your SearchAI application with  Oracle Knowledge, follow the below steps. 

## Step 1: Get Your Oracle B2C Service Knowledge Advanced Account Info

SearchAI fetches relevant data from the Oracle Knowledge base using REST APIs.  To access the REST APIs on the Oracle knowledge base, we need two types of users â€“ an API User with access to the required resources and a Console user. 

So, fetch the following information from your Oracle Knowledge account.

* REST Server URL 
* API User credentials
* Console user credentials

For more details on how to create an API user and Console user, refer to [this](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/b2c-service/cxska/OKCS_Authenticate_and_Authorize.html). 


## Step 2: Configure the Oracle Knowledge Connector

Go to the **Connectors** page and select **Oracle Knowledge**. On the Configuration page, enter the following details and click **Connect**.
