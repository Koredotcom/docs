# SharePoint Connector

Configure the SharePoint connector if you're using SharePoint to manage your content and want to make your existing content searchable with SearchAI. Configuring SharePoint as a content source requires:

* **Registering a multi-tenant app in SharePoint**
* **Configuration of the SharePoint connector in SearchAssist**

## Authorization Support

Search AI supports **OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant Type** mechanism for SharePoint.

## Registering multi-tenant app in SharePoint

App registrations are required to access resources programmatically. Registering an application establishes trust between the SearchAI application and the identity provider, the Microsoft identity platform. To register, 

* Log in to the [Azure Platform Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home) and go to Manage **Azure Active Directory**.

![Azure Home](../images/sharepoint/azure-home.png "Admin Center")

* Register a new application. To do so, go to **App Registrations** under **Applications** and click on **New Registration.**

![App Registration](../images/sharepoint/new-app-registration.png "Application Registration")

* Enter the application's name. Create a multi-tenant account and set the account type to ‘Accounts in any organization directory’. Set the Redirect URL and click **_Register_**. You can use one of the following URLs according to your region.
    * JP Region Callback URL: https://jp-bots-idp.kore.ai/workflows/callback
    * DE Region Callback URL: https://de-bots-idp.kore.ai/workflows/callback
    * Prod Region Callback URL: https://idp.kore.com/workflows/callback

* This will generate a client ID, which will be used to identify the application uniquely in the  Microsoft Identity Platform. Save the **ClientId** and **TenantId** from the **Overview** section.

![Client Credentials](../images/sharepoint/client-credentials.png "Client Credentials")

* Next, [Generate a client Secret for the registered app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#add-a-client-secret) under the **Certificates and Secrets** tab.

![Client Credentials](../images/sharepoint/client-secret.png "Client Credentials")

* Enter a description and set the expiration time to 24 months. Click **Add**.

 ![Client Credentials](../images/sharepoint/generate-secret.png "Client Credentials")

* Save the client secret generated. The client secret cannot be seen again on switching the tabs. 

![Client Credentials](../images/sharepoint/save-secret.png "Client Credentials")

* The next step is to set up the application's required permissions. Go to **API Permissions** and click **Add a permission**.

![API Permissions](../images/sharepoint/api-permissions.png "API Permissions")

* Add the following delegated permissions found under **Microsoft Graph**.
    * User.ReadBasic.All
    * Group.Read.All
    * Directory.AccessAsUser.All
    * Files.Read
    * Files.Read.All
    * Sites.Read.All
    * Offline_access
    
    ![Request Permissions](../images/sharepoint/request-permissions.png "Request Permissions")

* After adding all the permissions, click **_Grant Admin Consent_** to grant the permissions to the application.

![Grant Permissions](../images/sharepoint/grant-permissions.png "Grant Permissions")

* To configure the SharePoint connector in SearchAssist, use the client ID, client secret, and tenant ID generated above. For more details, refer to [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app).


## Configuration of the SharePoint connector 

Go to the **Connectors** under **Sources** and select **SharePoint**. On the Authorization page, enter the **Client ID**, **Tenant ID**, and **Client Secret** generated during the application registration in the Azure portal. Choose the desired content type—**All, Articles,** or **Files**. Assign a name for the connector, then click **Connect**.

This will authenticate with the SharePoint application. Once the authorization process is complete and the connector is configured, the next step is to select the SharePoint sites from which you want to ingest the content and make it searchable. Go to the **Configure** section, click the **Select Content** link, select the sites from which you want to ingest content, and click **Save**. Click on **Sync Now** to start content ingestion. 

## Access Control


### Understanding Permissions in SharePoint

Permissions to files and pages in SharePoint include **site-level permissions** and **individual permissions** to the files. 


### Site-level Permissions

There are **two membership groups** in SharePoint: **Office 365** ** groups and **SharePoint Security groups**. These groups grant different access to your site. Users using both groups receive access permissions.

You can view the **Office 365 Group Membership** for a site here. 

![Office 365 Membership](../images/sharepoint/racl/config-tab.png "Configuration")


Click on the **Members** button to view the list of members and their roles. 

![Office 365 Members](../images/sharepoint/racl/members.png "Members")


Another set of permissions allows users to access a site. Go to **settings** and click on **site permissions**. These are referred to as **SharePoint Security Groups.**

![Site Permissions](../images/sharepoint/racl/site-permissions.png "Site Permissions")


Every site has three default SharePoint permission levels, which differ in the access granted to the users. 

* Site visitors 
* Site members 
* Site owners


### Handling of Site Permissions in SearchAI

Corresponding to the **Office 365 Group Membership group, a permission entity** is created in the SearchAI application. **All the users added to this group are automatically added to this permission entity in SearchAI. However, if there are email groups added here, the members of the group should be added to the permission entity manually using the Permission Entity APIs.**

Similarly, corresponding to the **SharePoint Security Groups, three permission entities** are created in the SearchAI application. The users in these groups should be manually added to the corresponding permission entities using the Permission Entity APIs.  

Therefore, in the sourceACL field, you will see four permission entities corresponding to the site permissions. 


### File-level Permissions

The access control set for a site applies to all the files/pages within the site. Additionally, an owner of the file can share it with a new user, internally or externally. 

![File Permissions](../images/sharepoint/racl/file-permissions.png "File Permissions")

The owner can also share a file with all the domain or organization members. 

![Domain Access](../images/sharepoint/racl/domain-access.png "Domain Level Access")


### Handling of File Permissions in SearchAI

* When a file is shared with a specific user, the user is automatically added to the sourceACL field of the corresponding files during ingestion. 
* When a file is shared with a user group, the groupId is used to create a permission entity that can be used to resolve individual users. 
* When a file is shared with a specific domain, the domain name is stored as a permission entity in the sourceACL field. SearchAI automatically compares the user email IDs with the domain name during answer generation. If there is a match, access to the files is granted.
