# Conversation Summary API (Beta)

The API summarizes the conversation between a user and an agent. The agent can be a virtual agent or a human agent. The API accepts the conversation Id or the transcripts as input and provides an auto-generated conversation summary.

The API uses open-source LLM fine-tuned and hosted by Kore.ai for summarizing conversations using a large number of sample conversation transcripts from various fields and industries.

!!!note
    Currently, the API is in its beta phase and has some limitations. The API supports transcripts only in English (en) and is available only in our global deployment (https://platform.kore.ai). The generated summary may have factual inconsistencies and inaccurate representations due to limited coverage in the beta phase.
