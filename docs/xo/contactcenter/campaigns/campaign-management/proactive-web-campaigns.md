# Proactive Web Campaigns

Web campaigns are online strategic initiatives to promote a product, service, cause, or brand. They harness the power of web engagement to reach and engage target audiences. Their utility lies in their ability to amplify visibility, generate leads, foster brand awareness, and achieve predefined objectives with precision and measurable outcomes.

You can access the Proactive Web Campaigns by going to Campaign Management > Proactive Web.

## Templates

The purpose of using templates in web campaigns is to streamline and expedite the creation of consistent and visually appealing content. Templates provide a structured framework that enables you to plug in content elements, ensuring uniformity across various campaign materials. By using templates, marketers can save time, maintain brand coherence, and efficiently produce engaging content tailored to different platforms and audience segments. Additionally, templates facilitate collaboration among team members and enable swift adjustments and iterations based on campaign performance and feedback. Overall, templates enhance productivity, brand consistency, and campaign effectiveness in the dynamic landscape of digital marketing.

You can choose templates by going to Campaign Management > Proactive Web > + New Campaign > All Templates or Choose from Templates.

### Using a Template to Create a Proactive Web Campaign

Steps to create a proactive web campaign using a template:

1. Select the template that you want to use for the campaign. For example, Banner.
2. The template format appears. Select `Use this Template`.
3. The `New Proactive Web Campaign` page appears.
4. Enter the required information and create the web campaign.

### Schedule Proactive Web Campaigns

Scheduling enables precise control to deliver your messages. You can seamlessly plan campaigns to coincide with peak engagement times, ensuring maximum impact. Whether daily, weekly, Monthly, or Yearly, tailor your schedule to optimize outreach and enhance audience responsiveness. Scheduling a campaign activates the campaign at a designated date and time.

Steps to schedule a Campaign:

1. Select the Schedule tab and turn on the `Schedule Campaign` toggle.
2. Select the campaign `Start Date & Time`. `End Date & Time` is optional.  
3. Select the `Time Zone` to dial the campaign.
4. Turn on the Recurrence toggle if you want the campaign to recur at defined intervals. You can select from the following options:
    * Daily,
    * Weekly,
    * Monthly,
    * Yearly.

    `Every “Enter Value” day(s)` is a subset of what you select, Daily, Weekly, Monthly, or Yearly.  

    <img src="../images/recurrence-duration.gif" alt="Recurrence Precedence" title="Recurrence Precedence" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

    !!! Note

        When a Scheduled campaign completes the first occurrence, it considers that run as complete so on the next recurrence it starts reaching the contacts freshly.
        For example, If a campaign is scheduled to run every week on Monday then on the first occurrence of Monday, the dialer dials as many contacts as it can and then treat the contact list as completed. The next Monday the dialer again considers dialing all contacts in the list.

5. Turning on the Allow Recurrence Precedence toggle gives the recurrence start and end time precedence over Contactable timings.
For example, if Contactable Timings are 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM but the user selects Recurrence Start Time as 8:00 AM, the campaign starts contacting from 8:00 AM.  
<img src="../images/allow-recurrence-precedence.png" alt="Allow Recurrence Precedence" title="Allow Recurrence Precedence" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

6. Select `Save`.

    !!! Notes

        * When a timezone is selected in the `Contactable Timings` section, it automatically becomes the default timezone for scheduling in the 'Schedule' section. However, campaign managers can choose a different timezone from the dropdown if necessary.
        
        * When a campaign is scheduled, it becomes active at the specified date and time. However, the contacts are dialed according to the 'Contactable Timings' time and timezone settings.
        
        * To ensure accuracy, the contacts are scrubbed again 15 minutes before the scheduled time of a campaign.
        
        * A scheduled campaign automatically runs at the scheduled date or time but the contacts are dialed as per the contactable timings and timezone. Selecting `Run` for a scheduled campaign displays an error message.

### Stop a Scheduled Campaign

Select `Stop` under actions. Stopping a scheduled campaign ends the instance of that campaign; re-running a stopped scheduled campaign creates a new instance and dials all the contacts again.

Select`Stop` to confirm.

## Export and Import Web Campaigns

The Export and Import Web Campaigns feature enables supervisors to backup, migrate, and reuse Proactive Web Campaigns between accounts. It provides flexibility in campaign management while maintaining data integrity and traceability through detailed change logs.

### Export Campaigns

Supervisors can export one or more campaigns to a file for import into another account. They can export a maximum of 50 campaigns in a single operation. To export more, users must perform multiple export actions.

Selection Modes

The Export Campaigns option provides two selection modes to manage campaign selections.

Select All (Page-Level)

* Selects all campaigns visible on the current page.
* The selection resets when navigating to another page.
* If a user modifies the selection, the mode switches to Individual Selection.

Individual Selection (Multi-Page)

* Enables selecting specific campaigns across multiple pages.
* Selections persist when navigating to another page.
* Offers precise control over which campaigns to export.

Selections automatically clear when users perform any of the following actions:

* Apply search, filters, or date range.
* Sort data.
* Refresh the page.
* Save, clone, or delete campaigns.

**Exception**: Individual selections persist only during pagination.

The system exports the file as a CSV.

Each export action generates a log entry in the [Campaign Logs](./logs.md), capturing:

* The number of campaigns exported.
* The names of the exported campaigns.

### Import Campaigns

Supervisors can import all campaigns contained in an exported file. Partial imports (selecting specific campaigns from the file) aren't supported.

Import Result Scenarios and Notifications

| **Condition** | **User Message** | **Description** |
|----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| `All campaigns imported successfully` | NN Campaigns imported successfully! | Displays the number of campaigns (`NN`) successfully imported. |
| `Partial import (some failed)` | Import partially successful. XX successfully imported, YY failed. See the Campaigns log for more details.| Displays counts of successful (`XX`) and failed (`YY`) imports. |

Duplicate Campaign Handling

* The system records the details of skipped campaigns, including their names and the reasons for skipping them, in the Campaign Logs.
* Skipped campaigns don't affect the import of other campaigns.
* The system records the details of skipped campaigns, including their names and the reasons for skipping them, in the Campaign Logs.

Each import operation creates a detailed entry in the [Campaign Logs](./logs.md), capturing:

* The total number of campaigns imported successfully and those that failed.
* For each failed campaign:
    * Campaign name
    * Reason for failure
    * Corresponding line number from the `.jsonl` file within the `.zip` archive

All successfully imported campaigns display the label `Recently imported`. This label automatically expires at the end of the day.

## Campaign Suppression and Re-evaluation

ChatGPT said:

The system suppresses a campaign for a visitor for any of the following reasons:

* A cooldown period after another campaign executes  
* An active chat is in progress  
* A template from another campaign is active  
* Any other suppression condition  

The system continues to treat the suppressed campaign as a candidate. When the suppression reason is no longer valid, the system again evaluates the campaign when the website URL matches.

Campaign configuration

* Campaign 1

    * Website: Page1  
    * Rule: Page Visit Count (PVC) ≥ 1

* Campaign 2

    * Website: Page2  
    * Rule: PVC ≥ 1

* Campaign 3

    * Website: Page1  
    * Rule: PVC ≥ 1 and Time Spent (TS) = 30 seconds

Example:

* Campaign 2 triggers when the user visits Page 2 and meets the PVC rule.  
* The system suppresses Campaign 1 when the user navigates to Page 1 because Campaign 2’s template is active.  
* Campaign 3 triggers when the user closes Campaign 2’s template before 30 seconds because both PVC ≥ 1 and TS = 30 seconds meets the PVC rule. 
* Campaign 1 doesn't trigger again when the user closes Campaign 3’s template and remains on Page 1 because the system suppresses it during the same page visit.  
* Campaign 1 triggers when the user navigates to Page 2 and then back to Page 1 because the URL matches again and the suppression condition clears.  

!!! note 
 
    The suppression and re-evaluation behavior applies to all suppression types. The system uses a consistent suppression and reconsideration flow across all cases.

## Proactive Web Campaign Plugin for the Web SDK

The Proactive Web Campaign plugin extends the Web SDK, enabling dynamic, rule-based interactions with website visitors. With this plugin, you can define campaigns that trigger actions like displaying messages or starting chats based on visitor behavior.
