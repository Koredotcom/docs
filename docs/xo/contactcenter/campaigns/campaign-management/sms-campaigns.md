# SMS Campaigns

SMS campaigns use text messages to reach and engage a target audience for marketing, informational, or transactional purposes. These campaigns use the SMS channel to deliver concise, impactful messages directly to users' mobile phones. SMS campaigns are versatile and used for promotions, alerts, reminders, surveys, and customer support, offering businesses a direct and efficient way to communicate with their audience.

You can access Campaigns by going to **Campaign Management** > **SMS**.

    * **Campaign Name**: Enter a name for the campaign.
    * **Description**: Enter a description of the campaign.
    * **Contact Lists**: Select the contact lists that will be dialed, for the campaign from the drop-down list and then select **Done**. [Learn more](../list-management/list-management.md#contact-lists).
    * **DNC List**: Select the DNC List from the drop-down. [Learn more](../list-management/list-management.md#dnc-lists).
    * **Priority**: Select the priority for the campaign from the drop-down.  
    <img src="../images/general-tab-sms.png" alt="General Tab" title="General Tab" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

3. On the **Message** tab, you can select from two available formats:

    * **Simple**: This format is useful for sending simple outbound messages. Select a template for the SMS campaign from the drop-down. Click the 🖉 icon to enter the message to be shared.  
        <img src="../images/simple-message.png" alt="Simple Message" title="Simple Message" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

        !!! Note

            * Users can select system or custom templates and edit them for a particular campaign.
            * Editing a custom or system template modifies it for a specific campaign, and does not alter the original template. 
            * When a system or custom template is selected and the user chooses to edit it, the template selection drop-down resets to "None."

    * **Advanced**: This format is useful for two-way messaging (Inbound and Outbound) by linking to a start flow that contains dialog tasks. All the published start flows are displayed regardless of a number associated with them. This format can also be used to transfer to an agent using the attached flow. Select a start flow from the dropdown.  
        <img src="../images/advanced-message.png" alt="Advanced Message" title="Advanced Message" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

    <img src="../images/save-message-sms.png" alt="Save Message" title="Save Message" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

5. On the **Outreach Strategy** tab, first, select the Caller ID. Caller ID is the number that is used to send SMS, and the same number is displayed on the recipient's phone. All the numbers available in the app are available to be selected as the caller ID.  
In the Simple message format, the caller ID displays numbers configured for Outbound only, which are not linked to any flows.  
In the Advanced message format, businesses can establish two-way communication with their end customers. Using the Advanced message format, you can associate an SMS Flow that can take the end customers through an automation journey, run dialog tasks, and connect to live agents if required.

    <img src="../images/clone-button-sms.png" alt="Clone Button" title="Clone Button" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

    <img src="../images/cloned-campaign-sms.png" alt="Cloned Campaign" title="Cloned Campaign" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

## Delete an SMS Campaign

You can delete an SMS campaign if it has served its purpose or is no longer required.

Steps to delete an SMS campaign:

    <img src="../images/delete-button-sms.png" alt="Delete Campaign Button" title="Delete Campaign Button" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

    <img src="../images/delete-campaign-confirmation-sms.png" alt="Delete Campaign Confirmation" title="Delete Campaign Confirmation" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:60%;">  

## Run SMS Campaigns

Running an SMS campaign changes the campaign status to **Active** and sends the configured message to the numbers in the contact lists. Campaigns run based on their configured priority.

Steps to run an SMS Campaign:

1. Click the **Play** button and then click **Run**.  
    <img src="../images/run-button.png" alt="Run Button" title="Run Button" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">  

    When the campaign runs, you can pause or stop it. You can also rerun a completed campaign.

## Run as Emergency

The campaign runs immediately, overriding any schedule and calling hours. It uses the available SMS capacity and starts instantly, regardless of whether contacts are listed or API-integrated. This campaign processes first at full capacity, followed by other high-priority campaigns and schedules. After completion, the schedule changes to manual if it was previously scheduled.

Steps to run an Emergency SMS Campaign:

1. Click the **Play** button and then click **Run as Emergency**.  
    <img src="../images/run-as-emergency.png" alt="Run as Emergency" title="Run as Emergency" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">

2. A pop-up alert appears. Click **Confirm** to proceed.  
    <img src="../images/emergency-campaign-alert.png" alt="Emergency Campaign Confirmation" title="Emergency Campaign Confirmation" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">

3. A warning appears at the top, and a warning icon is displayed next to the campaign name.  
<img src="../images/emergency-campaign-run.png" alt="Warning Notification" title="Warning Notification" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">  

    An emergency campaign cannot be paused or resumed; it can only be stopped and rerun. Users can manually stop an active emergency campaign. If rerun, the campaign resumes and completes sending SMS.

    If the contact list is a **.csv file**, the emergency campaign ends after sending an SMS to all contacts. If the contact list is **API-integrated**, the user must manually stop the campaign.

    Only one emergency campaign can run per workspace or account. If a user clicks **Run as Emergency** for another campaign, the system checks for an ongoing emergency campaign and displays a warning if one is in progress.  
    <img src="../images/currently-active-campaign-alert.png" alt="Alert Notification" title="Alert Notification" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">  

    !!! Notes

        * A user cannot run or rerun an ongoing active campaign as an emergency. To do so, they must stop the ongoing campaign and rerun it as an emergency.
        * A non-emergency campaign, once paused, can only be resumed as a non-emergency campaign.
        * If an error occurs during the API pull of contacts, ongoing campaigns remain active and are not impacted.

## Stop an SMS Campaign

Stopping an SMS resets the data, the campaign status changes to **Stopped**, and a new instance of the campaign is created when you rerun the campaign.

Steps to stop an SMS campaign:

1. Click the **Stop** button under **Actions** for the campaign you want to stop.  
    <img src="../images/stop-button.png" alt="Stop Button" title="Stop Button" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

2. A confirmation pop-up window appears. Click **Stop**.
