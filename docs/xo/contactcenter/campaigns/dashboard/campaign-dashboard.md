The Outcome section presents detailed insights into call dispositions for outbound dialer campaigns.

Outbound Dialer Disposition (Top 5)

* Displays the top five most frequent dispositions returned by the dialer.  
* Categories include Busy, Connected, Failed, No Answer, Answering Machine, DNC Excluded, Filter Skipped, and Retry Cancelled.  
* Each disposition appears along the horizontal axis.  
* The vertical axis shows the count for each disposition.  

Agent Disposition (Top 5)

* Displays the top five dispositions selected by agents after engaging with connected calls.  
* Categories include Unresolved, Requires Supervisor, Resolved, System Generated, and other custom dispositions.  
* The horizontal axis lists disposition names, and the vertical axis shows the count.  

### Disposition

The Dispositions vs. Attempts table shows how each outbound attempt is recorded against its final status. As a conversation moves through multiple attempts, the system counts only the latest outcome and maps it to the corresponding disposition–attempt combination.

Table Structure

* The X-axis lists all dispositions configured for the campaign.  
* The Y-axis lists attempt numbers, starting from 1.  
* The table appears for all campaigns, including campaigns in progress.  

The system counts only the latest attempt for each conversation. When a conversation moves to a new attempt, the previous attempt’s entry is removed. The table continuously updates to reflect the campaign’s real-time progress.

Calculation Rules

* Each latest attempt contributes one count to the cell that matches its disposition and attempt number.  
* Includes ongoing conversations based on their current attempt and disposition.  

Example workflow

* Attempt 1: Conversation C ends with Unanswered → the system counts it in (Unanswered, 1).  
* Attempt 2: The conversation reaches Needs-Terms-Explanation → the system removes it from (Unanswered, 1) and counts it in (Needs-Terms-Explanation, 2).  
* Attempt 3 (final): The conversation ends with Not Interested → the system removes it from (Needs-Terms-Explanation, 2) and counts it in (Not Interested, 3).
