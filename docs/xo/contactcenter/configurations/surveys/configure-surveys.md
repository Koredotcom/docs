Surveys let you send customers a satisfaction survey after they interact with your business.

To access surveys, go to **Contact Center AI** > **CONFIGURATIONS** > **Surveys**.

## How Surveys Work

The Surveys feature lets you get customer satisfaction ratings after conversations. You can only create one survey, which you can assign to voice, chat, or both.

The system sends the survey according to a frequency that you can customize. After a customer conversation ends, the system or agent can ask the customer to provide feedback using a survey form.

When selecting the Feedback option, customers see a short survey through which they can rate the conversation on a scale from 1 to 5 (1 is extremely poor, while 5 is extremely good).

The submitted rating reflects in the Dashboard, under the Queues and Agents view, as the _Average Satisfaction Rating_ and _Customer Satisfaction by Channel._
