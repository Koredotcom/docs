## Key Features

* Routing rules based on agent skills.
* Message options for both voice and chat requests:
    * Initial message when a request is assigned to a queue.
    * Hold audio for calls,
    * Deliver Periodic messages while contacts wait-both for calls and chats.
* Message language configuration.
* Callback if the wait time exceeds a specified limit.
* Send a voicemail if the call wait duration exceeds a specified limit, the queue position is too long, or the estimated wait time exceeds a specified limit.

    3. **Chat Experience**, where you can customize the Waiting Experience for chats.

<img src="../images/add-new-waiting-experience.png" alt="Waiting Experience Configuration" title="Waiting Experience Configuration" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

#### Name and Description

Provide a **Name** and a brief **Description** of the Waiting Experience.  
<img src="../images/name-and-description.png" alt="Name and Description" title="Name and Description" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

#### Routing Rules

Define the configuration rules for the **Skill Group** and **Skill** waiting queue constraints.

1. Select the Skill Group, then the Skill that the Waiting Experience matches;
2. Select the row-wise **+Add** option to add a new row to the existing **Routing Rule** (OR) condition and the **Delete** icon to delete a row;
3. Configure the **AND/OR** conditional logic by hovering over a rule row and toggling between the tabs, as shown in the demo;
4. To configure the _AND_ condition, select **+ Add**;
5. To remove a rule, select the **Delete** (**ⓧ**) icon next to the row. To delete a rule section, select the **Delete** icon next to it.  
    <img src="../images/routing-rules-demo.gif" alt="Routing Rules Demo" title="Routing Rules Demo" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

    The system first filters all Waiting Experiences that match the conversation skills. It then sorts them by the number of routing rules in descending order to select the most specific Waiting Experience. If multiple Waiting Experiences have the same number of rules, the system selects the one created earliest.

    Example: For a conversation with `Skill A` and `Skill B`, if one Waiting Experience requires only `Skill A` and another requires both `Skill A` and `Skill B`, the system selects the latter because it has more routing rules and provides a more specific match.

### Call Experience
