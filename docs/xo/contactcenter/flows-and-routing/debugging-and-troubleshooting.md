# Debug and Troubleshoot

The Debug window helps you review natural language processing details, logs, and the session context and variables for a chat. To access it, click the Debug icon in the upper-right corner of the chat window.

The Debug window includes three tabs:

* **Debug Log**: Records dialog task activity, including Script Node, Service Node, and Webhook Node logs, with timestamps.  
* **NL Analysis**: Provides task loading details and, for each user utterance, displays task name analysis and recognition scores.  
* **Session Context & Variables**: Lists the context object and session variables used in dialog task execution.

## Debug Log

The **Debug Log** outlines the step-by-step flow of an interaction, capturing the session context and variables at each stage. It uses a chat-style format, grouping user inputs with system responses to simplify conversation tracking. This layout enhances navigation, presents contextual information clearly, and streamlines the debugging process. [Learn more](../../automation/testing/talk-to-bot.md#debug-log).
