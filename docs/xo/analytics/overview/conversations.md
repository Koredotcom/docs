# Conversations

Conversations provides insights into the AI Agents Conversations. You can use the logs to review your AI Agent’s performance and troubleshoot issues with conversations.

To view the Conversations dashboard, follow the steps:

1. Go to **Analytics** > **Overview** > **Conversations**.  
    <img src="../images/interactions-page.png" alt="Conversations Page" title="Conversations Page" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

2. On this page, the following details of the logs appear in a table:

  * CUSTOMER: The contact who initiated the conversation.
     * Direction (Icon): The direction of the conversation -  Inbound or Outbound.
    * Language (Icon): The language of the conversation.
    * Channel (Icon): The Channel of the conversation - Voice, Chat, or Email.

    Administrators can configure the system to hide customer Email IDs and Phone Numbers in the Conversations, Details slider, and Export file. Instead, the system displays the internal User ID. [Learn more](../../contactcenter/configurations/settings/obscure-customer-info-in-analytics-interactions.md).

* ACTIONS: You can download recordings and transcripts, and copy the following Identifiers:
    * User ID
    * Session ID

* Duration: The duration of the inbound conversation.
* Agents: The profile pictures of the agents who handled the conversation appears in the order in which they participated. Hovering over the profile pictures shows the names of the agents.
* Queues: The last queue name appears with a +N for more queues. Hovering on the queues shows the order in which the conversation entered the queues.
* Skills: One skill appears with a +N for more skills. Hovering over the skills shows all skills associated with the conversation.
* Status: The statuses of the conversation are as follows:
    * In Progress: In Progress refers to an ongoing conversation. The Conversations tab immediately displays a conversation that's in progress.
    * Error: Error is a disruption to an ongoing conversation, resulting in an error message. Failure of integrated systems results in errors.
    * Completed (Drop Off): Completed (Drop Off) refers to a voice call where there was no response from the user, and the conversation ends.
    * Completed (User Hangup): Completed (User Hangup) refers to a voice call where the user ends the conversation.
    * Completed (AI Agents Hangup): Completed (AI Agents Hangup) refers to a voice call where the AI Agent completes the task and ends the call, and the AI Agents ends the conversation.
    * Completed: Completed refers to a chat conversation where the AI Agent completes the task and ends the conversation.

## Supervisor Actions

Supervisors can view ongoing Conversations on the Conversations tab. They can intervene as a supervisor, similar to the Monitor tab, and join, reassign, or change the queue of any interaction visible on the Conversations tab.

Steps to perform supervisor actions:

1. Select **Conversations** under the **Overview** section of the **Analytics** panel. The **Conversations** dashboard appears on the right side of the page.

2. Select **⋮** under ACTIONS and then select **Supervisor View**.  
<img src="../images/supervisor-actions.png" alt="Supervisor Actions" title="Supervisor Actions" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

3. You are redirected to the Conversations section on the Monitor tab.  
  <img src="../images/supervisor-actions-1.png" alt="Supervisor Actions 1" title="Supervisor Actions 1" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

4. Select the ongoing conversation. You can perform the following actions in the conversation:
    * Join Conversation
    * Assign
    * Change Queue  
    <img src="../images/supervisor-actions-2.png" alt="Supervisor Actions 2" title="Supervisor Actions 2" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

## Search Conversations

You can find the search field on the top right side of the Conversations tab.  
<img src="../images/search-interactions.png" alt="Search Conversations" title="Search Conversations" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

The search feature on Conversations lets supervisors to do the following:

* Search for keywords in both chats and call transcripts.
* Search the Agent and Disposition notes.
* Exclude Agent AI Logs when searching the Transcripts.
* Search on Partial and Full Matches of Words and Phrases: The search function works for partial and complete matches of individual words and phrases.
    * Complete matches receive the highest rank in the search results.
    * Results that match all single words of a phrase receive the next priority.
    * Results that receive the last priority are those where only a few words of a phrase match.
* The search also provides an option to sort results by timestamp. By default, search results appear in order of relevance, with the most relevant results listed first. You can select the Start Time column to sort results by timestamp in either ascending or descending order.  
* Ignore common words like Articles, Pronouns, and Prepositions while matching.

How it works:

1. Enter a word or phrase in the search field and search the **Search** icon.

2. The count of search results appears.  
    <img src="../images/search-interactions-1.png" alt="Search Conversations 1" title="Search Conversations 1" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

3. When you select a conversation, the Insights to Logs window appears. Enter the word or phrase in the search field to prompt the system to search for it in the conversation.  
    <img src="../images/search-interactions-2.png" alt="Search Conversations 2" title="Search Conversations 2" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

4. The system displays the count of the occurrences of the word or phrase along with the highlighted results.  
    <img src="../images/search-interactions-3.png" alt="Search Conversations 3" title="Search Conversations 3" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

!!! Note

    The search button works in two ways. By default, OpenSearch is enabled in all standard cloud deployments. However, if your deployment is on a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) or a custom setup, OpenSearch must be deployed separately. When OpenSearch is available, you can use the full search functionality. If OpenSearch is not deployed, the search works, but it supports only ID-based searches.

## Export/Download Recording, Transcripts, Latency Report, and Events

You can download the recording, transcripts, latency reports, and events to your local system from the dashboard.

Steps to export conversation data/transcripts:

1. Select the conversations and select **Export**.  
    <img src="../images/export-button.png" alt="Export" title="Export" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

2. Select **Export Conversation Data**, **Export Transcripts**, or **Export Events** as required.

    or

    Select **Download Chat Transcript**, or **Download Latency Report**. The transcript and latency report downloads in .csv format.  
    <img src="../images/download-options-interactions.png" alt="Download Options" title="Download Options" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;"> 

    !!! Notes

        * If you select Export Conversation Data, the system exports the metadata for all selected conversations.
        * If you select Export Transcripts, the system exports transcript files using the standard naming convention for transcript exports. The files are compressed into a zip file named transcripts-YYYY-MM-DD-HH24-mm-SS.zip.
        * You can select up to 25 conversations for transcript export. If a selected conversation doesn't have a transcript or the system cannot retrieve it, the export includes a blank transcript for that conversation.
        * The system displays a status message when the export starts. After the export completes, the file downloads automatically.
        * Add the following [Call Control Parameters](../../channels/voice-gateway/speech-customization.md#introduction-to-call-control-parameters) to enable the Download Latency Report option
            `notifySttLatency = true`  
            `vadEnable = true`  
            `vadVendor = silero`
        * When the permission is not granted or is disabled, users see inactive download buttons, and an access restriction message appears on hover. For details about permissions, see [Permissions](../../user-management/role-management.md#permissions).

3. A status message appears at the start of the export. On completion, the file downloads.

    !!! Notes "Download Events"

        * The Download Events option are unavailable for conversations over 30 days old.
        * Events are recorded periodically, so the exported document may not always reflect the entire event history. For a comprehensive record, it is recommended to download the events once the conversation has ended.

    <img src="../images/preview-events-page.png" alt="Preview Events Page" title="Preview Events Page" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

4. A confirmation is displayed when the event is exported.  
    <img src="../images/export-completed.png" alt="Export Completed" title="Export Completed" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">  

    The system exports the following events and their timestamps for chat and voice conversations.  
    * Routing Initiation  
    * Conversation Acceptance  
    * Conversation Rejection  
    * Conversation Transfer  
    * Transfer Failures  
    * Agent join  
    * Agent left  
    * Agent Consultation  
    * Skill Change  
    * Disposition Updates  
    * After-Call Work (ACW)  
    * Conversation Closure  

## Latency Metrics (Beta)

The Latency Metrics feature measures how long each stage of a voice interaction takes Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), bot processing, TTS, and the overall end-to-end response time. The following sections define each metric with formulas and examples.

* **ASR Latency**: The time between when the user stops speaking and when the ASR provider returns the complete transcription.

    Formula:
    `ASR Latency = User stops speaking → ASR returns full transcript`

    Example:

    * User stops speaking: `10:00:05.000`
    * ASR returns transcript: `10:00:05.450`
    * ASR Latency = 450 ms

* **Bot Latency**: The time between when the Voice Gateway (VG) sends the transcription to the platform and when VG receives the full response.

    Formula:
    `Bot Latency = VG sends transcript → VG receives bot response`

    Example:

    * Transcript sent: `10:00:05.450`
    * Bot response received: `10:00:06.300`
    * Bot Latency = 850 ms

* **TTS Latency**: The time between when VG sends the bot’s response text to the TTS provider and when VG receives the first byte of synthesized audio (Time to First Byte).

    Formula:
    `TTS Latency = VG sends TTS request → VG receives first audio byte`

    Notes:

    * Captures only the first audio byte arrival time.
    * Total TTS audio-generation time isn't shown.

    Example:

    * TTS request sent: `10:00:06.300`
    * First audio byte received: `10:00:06.700`
    * TTS Latency = 400 ms

* **End-to-End Latency**: The total time between when the user stops speaking and when the first audio byte plays back to the user.

    Formula:
    `End-to-End Latency = User stops speaking → First audio byte heard`

    Example:

    * User stops speaking: `10:00:05.000`
    * First audio byte heard: `10:00:06.700`
    * End-to-End Latency = 1.7 seconds

Summary Table

| Metric                 | Measures Time Between                                | Represents                                | Example |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------|
| ASR Latency            | User stops speaking → ASR full transcript             | Speed of speech recognition                | 450 ms  |
| Bot Latency            | VG sends transcript → VG gets bot response            | Bot processing and platform delays         | 850 ms  |
| TTS Latency            | VG sends TTS request → VG receives first audio byte   | TTS responsiveness (Time to First Byte)    | 400 ms  |
| End-to-End Latency     | User stops speaking → user hears first audio byte     | Full round-trip delay                      | 1.7 s   |

## Edit Dispositions from the Conversations Tab

Supervisors can edit or override disposition codes after a conversation ends. Agents assign dispositions during live sessions, but once the session completes, supervisors can review and revise the assigned codes directly from the Conversations Tab. This capability ensures accurate categorization of Conversations and supports streamlined post-conversation workflows. Administrators can enable this functionality for specific roles. [Learn more](../../user-management/role-management.md#permissions).

Key Highlights:

* Improved auditing and compliance
* Accurate reporting and resolution tracking
* Reduced dependency on agents for post-call updates
* Agents receive a notification when a supervisor updates a disposition.

Steps to edit dispositions:

1. Select a completed interaction for which the disposition has to be revised.
2. Select the **DETAILS** tab in the Insights to Logs window.
3. Select **Edit Disposition**.

### Troubleshooting

Why can’t I see my call recording?

After every voice call, the system automatically tries to fetch the call recording from the recording server. Usually, the recording becomes available within 10 minutes.

However, sometimes there may be a short delay or a temporary issue that prevents the recording from appearing immediately in your dashboard.

Behind the Scenes

The platform automatically attempts to fetch the call recording 10 minutes after completing the call.  

* If the recording is available, it's available to the user.  
* If the recording retrieval fails, users can manually retry fetching it. Also, the system automatically retries fetching the recording after 24 hours.  

Even without a manual retry, background jobs continue to make periodic attempts to retrieve the recording.

Common Reasons for Delay or Failure

* Temporary network or connectivity issues between Kore’s system and the recording server.  

* High server load delaying recording generation.  

* The system hasn't finalized the recording file, or the recording server is processing it.  

* Sometimes, a system error or missing call metadata prevents proper retrieval.

Tips for Users

* Wait at least **10 minutes** after the call ends before expecting the recording to appear.  

* Use **Retry** if the recording doesn’t show up.  

* If the issue persists beyond 24 hours, contact your administrator or raise a support ticket with details such as **Call ID**, **Timestamp**, and **Caller Number**.

### Flow

The Flow tab provides a detailed timeline of call signaling and media flow between endpoints. This interface displays the sequence of SIP messages and RTCP packets exchanged during a call, allowing Agents and Supervisors to track the complete communication flow and troubleshoot connection issues.  
<img src="../images/flow-tab.png" alt="Flow Tab" title="Flow Tab" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">  

The top row displays the IP addresses of all endpoints involved in the communication.

Example:

* 50.19.12.248
* 172.31.11.64
* 172.31.11.62
* 172.31.11.64

**SIP Message Flow**

The interface shows SIP signaling messages exchanged between endpoints:

1. **INVITE**
    * Direction: 50.19.12.248 to 172.31.11.64
    * Port: 5060 → 5060
    * Details: `INVITE sip: +12513254563@domain...`
    * Timestamp: [1][UU09]2024-04-15 15:29:37.679 +05:30 +0.000s

2. **100 (Trying)**
    * Direction: 172.31.11.64 to 50.19.12.248
    * Port: 5060 ← 5060
    * Details: `INVITE sip: +12513254563@domain...`
    * Timestamp: [1][UU09]2024-04-15 15:29:37.679 +05:30 +0.000s

3. **200 (OK)**
    * Direction: 172.31.11.64 to 50.19.12.248
    * Port: 5060 ← 5060
    * Details: `INVITE sip: +12513254563@domain...`
    * Timestamp: [1][UU09]2024-04-15 15:29:37.679 +05:30 +0.000s

4. **ACK**
    * Direction: 50.19.12.248 to 172.31.11.64
    * Port: 5060 → 5060
    * Details: `INVITE sip: +12513254563@domain...`
    * Timestamp: [1][UU09]2024-04-15 15:29:37.679 +05:30 +0.000s

The interface also shows RTCP media packets exchanged between endpoints:

1. **RTCP (First packet)**
    * Direction: 172.31.11.62 to 172.31.11.64
    * Port: 5060 → 5060
    * Details: `INVITE sip: +12513254563@domain...`
    * Timestamp: [1][UU09]2024-04-15 15:29:37.679 +05:30 +0.000s

2. **RTCP (Second packet)**

    * Direction: 172.31.11.62 to 172.31.11.64
    * Port: 5060 → 5060
    * Details: `INVITE sip: +12513254563@domain...`
    * Timestamp: [1][UU09]2024-04-15 15:29:37.679 +05:30 +0.000s

**How to Use?**

1. **Track Call Setup**: Follow the initial INVITE, 100 Trying, 200 OK, and ACK sequence to verify proper call establishment.
2. **Analyze Response Times**: Note the timestamps to identify any delays in message processing.
3. **Monitor Media Flow**: Review RTCP packets to ensure media is flowing properly between endpoints.
4. **Identify Issues**: Look for missing messages or unexpected responses that might indicate connection problems.
5. **Export Data**: Use the export options to save the communication flow for further analysis.

### QoS (Quality of Service) 

The QoS tab provides detailed network metrics for call monitoring and troubleshooting. It offers comprehensive data visualization of network performance indicators to help Agents and Supervisors analyze call quality.
