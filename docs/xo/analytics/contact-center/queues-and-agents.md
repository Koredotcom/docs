## Overview of Incoming Conversations

This section displays the metrics for all conversations (phone, chat, and email):

* Total Conversations-Total conversation count for the selected time range.
* In Queue-Count conversations in a queue.
* Ongoing-Count of ongoing conversations.
* Idle-Count of Idle conversations.
* Expired-Count of expired conversations.
* Closed-Count of closed conversations.

COMPARE: The COMPARE toggle compares all historical metrics over a previous equal-sized time range. For example, if the Average Handle Time is 12m 2s for the last 30 days the previous Average Handle Time was 6m 1s. If you select Compare, an increase of 50% over the last 30 days displays.

Transfer Rate-Percentage of transferred conversations.

Abandon Rate-Percentage of abandoned conversations.

Clicking the percentage value on the Abandon Rate widget shows the following information:

* `Abandoned while in Queue`-Count of conversations (NNNN) that were abandoned while waiting in the queue.
* `Abandoned while with Agent`-Count of conversations (NNNN) that where abandoned while being attended by an Agent.

    <img src="../images/abandon-rate.png" alt="Abandon Rate" title="Abandon Rate" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

The formula for measuring the Abandon Count:

* For Digital Channels:
`Abandon Count` = User Abandons While Waiting in Queue + Conversations With Agent that went through the Idle-Expired Sequence.
* For Voice Channels:
`Abandon Count` = User Abandons While Waiting in Queue + Conversations With Agent where User Disconnects While Agent has put the call on hold.

Overdue-This live metric shows the number of conversations in the overdue state. It displays the number based on all the conversations associated with the selected queues and agents.

System Terminations: Count of conversations terminated by the System. This metric appears based on selected queues only. Clicking on the number displays the details of the system terminations.

<img src="../images/system-terminations.png" alt="System Terminations" title="System Terminations" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

Average Speed to Answer-The average time it takes an agent to respond to a conversation assigned to them.

Average Handling Time-The average handling time of the conversations.

Queue Load-Displays the current load on the system as a percentage of its capacity. This is a live metric.

Resolved Rate-Percentage of resolved conversations.

<img src="../images/resolved-rate.png" alt="Resolved Rate" title="Resolved Rate" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

* The Resolution Disposition Set is marked as default and appears as the default option in Disposition & Notes on the Live Interactions pane of the Agent Console. For additional information on Disposition Sets, refer to Disposition Sets.

* The multi-colored progress bar appears only for the codes in the selected Disposition Set.
* Separate progress bars appear under each Disposition Code.

**Average Satisfaction Rating**: Displays the customer satisfaction rating based on the count of survey responses.

   <img src="../images/average-satisfaction-rating.png" alt="Average Satisfaction Rating" title="Average Satisfaction Rating" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

**Customer Satisfaction by Channel**: This section displays channel-wise customer satisfaction metrics based on survey responses.

   <td>Incoming = InQueue + Active + Idle + Expired + Completed + Transferred Out (The Q&A dashboard shows all transferred, even those back to the same queue).

   Completed = AbandonedInQueue + SystemTerminated + All-Conversations-With-Resolutions.

   **Note**: This formula is applicable when a call doesn't return to the same queue multiple times. If it does, it gets counted multiple times and doesn't add up correctly.

   **Question**. Does the Incoming count include Inbound and Outbound calls?<br>
   **Answer**: Yes, if the conversations (calls/chats) entered that queue.

   **Question**. Is the Incoming call count taken from the queue?<br>
   **Answer**: Yes. However, for `No-Filters`, the incoming call count includes conversations directly transferred from the AI Agents to the Agent, without entering a queue.
