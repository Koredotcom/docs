# Dashboard

The Dashboard provides a 360-degree view of Audit details, Fail Statistics, and Performance Monitoring of the Agent Evaluation Forms on a Daily, Weekly, and Monthly basis. It holds the last seven months of a year's data. By default, the Dashboard shows the Daily report for all three categories. This provides a quick glance through to monitor the quality standard at a given point of time.
