# Conversation Mining

The Conversation Mining feature allows you to drill down to interactions that are of interest to you or interactions that have the most potential to improve enabling you to eliminate the guesswork from manual evaluations and focus your manual efforts solely on critical interactions.

You can access Conversation Mining by navigating to **Contact Center AI** > **Quality AI** > **Analyze** > **Conversation Mining**.  

<img src="../conversation-mining/conversation-mining-interaction-default.png" alt="Bookmarks" title="Bookmarks" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

The Conversation Mining has the following two sections:

* Interactions
* Audit Allocations


    !!! Note

        Interactions are populated a few seconds after call termination. 

## Interactions

Users can see scored interactions or evaluation information at a glance from Conversation Mining. Users can apply filters to focus on specific interactions or with high potential for improvement and save the filters for auditing purposes. Interactions visible on the conversation mining screen are limited to the user's assigned queues.

The Conversation Mining interaction listing option enables users to quickly identify specific interactions of interest, eliminating the need to sift through numerous individual interaction records. This provides valuable insights for informed decision-making, enhances operational efficiency, and reduces the time spent on manual reviews through targeted analysis, ultimately improving oversight quality. Additionally, users can customize the interaction listing page by adding extra metadata and columns.

The Conversation Mining Interactions has the following key Items:

* **Agents**: Shows the agent who last participated in the interaction and has terminated this call. By hovering over the agents, the users can view the tagged topics and tagged intent.

  * **Topic Tags**: Each interaction shows all classified topics as tags. When topic filters are applied, relevant tags are highlighted in a different color. If filters are changed or cleared, highlighted tags are updated accordingly based on the new selections made. 

  * **Intent Tags**: Each interaction shows classified intents as tags.If filters are changed or cleared, the highlighted tags will update based on the new selections.

#### Filter by Efficiency

This provides an operational view of areas of interest where there is greater potential for improvement.

1. Select a type of conversation interaction **Channels**, such as **Voice** or **Chat**.
2. Choose the **Audit Status** if it is **Audited**, **Assigned**, or **Not Assigned**.
3. From the **Queues** list, add the Queue names.
4. From the **Agent Groups** list, add the agent group name based on the queue selected.

    !!! Note

        The user can filter the** Agent,** based on the interactions that are part of the queues and the user is part of.

5. From the **Agents**list, add the agent name based on the queue selected.

    !!! Note

        The user can filter the **Agent Groups**, who are part of the queues, not based on agents in the agent group that are part of other queues.

6. Enable either of the following options:
    * **Average Handling Time (AHT)**: Filters interactions based on the start and end of handling time range of interaction.
    * **Filter by deviation from AHT**: Filters interactions by % deviation from the average handling time across all interactions for the respective date range and the interactions that are going wrong.  
      <img src="../images/conversation-mining-interaction-filters-by-efficiency.png" alt="Filterby Efficiency" title="Filter by Efficiency" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">
