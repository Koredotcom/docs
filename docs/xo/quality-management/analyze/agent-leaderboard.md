# Agent Leaderboard

The Agent Leaderboard feature allows auditors and managers to view both top and bottom-performing agents, along with their conversations. This helps to make informed decisions regarding incentives and coaching assignments. Based on the agents' rankings, it becomes easier to identify and assign coaching assignments to lower-performing agents as needed. This widget shows all the agents across queues and channels with a functionality to sort across all the columns.

You can view Agent Leaderboard by navigating to **Contact Center AI** > **Quality Management** > **Analyze** > **Agent Leaderboard**.

!!! Note

    If the Agent Scorecard toggle option is disabled in the **Settings** of Quality Management by the administrator for a particular agent, then the agent will not be able to start the automated agent scoring.

The Agent Leaderboard shows all the agents across queues and channels which includes the following list of items:

* **Agents**: This shows the agent name and queue that it belongs to.
* **Agent Score Card**: This shows the number of scorecards assigned to the agent and the agent score (Across all queues).

!!! Note

    If a scorecard is designated as the default, the score shown will be based on that default scorecard. If no default scorecard is set, the score displayed will be the average of all applicable scorecards for that agent.

* **Total Interactions**: This shows the total number of interactions or overall number of interactions terminated by the agent for the time period.

* **Kore Evaluation Score**: This shows the average Kore evaluation score against each interaction audited.

* **Coaching Assignments**: This shows the number of coaching assignments or sessions assigned to the agent for the selected time.
* **Fail Percentage**: This shows the failure percentage across all interactions.

* **Search**: This allows you to search for agents that are part of the same queues that an agent belongs to.
