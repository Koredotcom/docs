# Settings - Conversation Intelligence

These settings allow you to make app-level changes to conversation intelligence.

The Settings has the following two sections:

* Conversation Intelligence
* Quality AI

## Conversation Intelligence

This extracts valuable insights from customer interactions across various communication channels. It captures information from spoken and written conversations, matches the information with structured metadata about the interaction, and analyzes emotions and feelings to understand customers' desires, needs, opinions, and expectations.

You can access the **Conversation Intelligence** by navigating to **Contact Center AI** > **Quality Management** > **Configure** > **Settings** > **Conversation Intelligence**.

### **Script Adherence Configuration**

This allows you to add and define a set of dynamic messages or scripts for the user or agent. By default, the script adherence widget uses a default generic script to check for adherence, using this app level configuration, the user can set custom messages for each step of the script to visualize adherence to the custom message instead of the default script message.

Steps to enable the Script Adherence Configuration:



1. Expand the **Conversation Intelligence** collapse icon, and** **enable the toggle button of **Conversation Intelligence Dashboard** and **Script adherence configuration**.

    

<p id="gdcalert6" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image6.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert7">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

2. Define the scripts for the below attributes to check the agent adherence.
* **Attribute**: Shows script steps like Greeting, Branding, and so on, where custom messages can be added.
* **Message**: Shows the custom messages that are already configured.
* **Action**: Enables you to enter messages for the agent by toggling the action button.

        By default, the action button is disabled but the user can enter the custom message for any of the desired attributes. 


        Upon enabling, the system will check adherence to the configured messages for the script adherence section of conversation intelligence instead of the default messages.

* **Message**: Allows you to define specified attribute messages for the agent or user. You can add more than one message for the user for the same attribute and delete the defined messages. 
* Click **Save **to save the defined messages.

At the agent account level, the agent can only check the following options defined by the supervisor or app owner or administrator in the Settings.



* In the Conversation Intelligence Dashboard, the agent can check the post-interaction analytics, such as brand tags, greetings, questions, emotions, interactions, and so on. 
* In the Script adherence configuration, the agent can visualize the specific messages or scripts that are defined by the supervisor or app owner or administrator.
