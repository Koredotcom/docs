# Incoming Interactions

## Next In Queue Notifications

The section at the bottom-left corner of the Agent Console displays new interactions assigned to an agent along with the count.

## Browser Notifications

A system push notification accompanies new interactions, so you can see them even when the browser is minimized or the Agent Console isn't in use. System notifications are supported for Chrome, Firefox, Chromium-based Microsoft Edge, and Safari. Each notification plays a sound, too.

When the first notification is pushed, your browser asks you to allow notifications from Contact Center AI. Permit this if you want to receive such notifications or block if you don't. If you block these notifications, you continue to hear the sound alert and see the Next in Queue popup under your Conversation Tray when opening the Agent Console.

## Channel Selection

Agents can choose their preferred channel (digital or voice) for handling incoming interactions. This feature enables better workload management and clearer handling of interaction types.

### Setting Your Preferred Channel

1. Open the Agent Console and select the channel selection icon.
2. Select one of the following options:
    * **Voice & Digital**: Receive all interaction types (system default).
    * **Digital**: Handle only digital interactions (chat, SMS, email).
    * **Voice**: Handle only voice calls.

!!! Note

    Channel selection is only available when blended mode is disabled.

### How Channel Selection Works

#### Voice & Digital Selection

When you select Voice & Digital:

* You'll receive both voice & digital interactions (voice, chat, SMS, email).
* You can simultaneously handle both voice and chat interactions.

#### Digital Selection

When you select Digital:

* You'll receive only digital interactions (chat, SMS, email).
* Voice interactions won't be routed to you.
* You must complete all digital interactions before switching to voice.

#### Voice Selection

When you select Voice:

* You'll receive only voice calls.
* Digital interactions won't be routed to you.
* You must complete all voice interactions before switching to digital.

## Handling Incoming Interactions Based on Answer Mode

### Manual Answer Mode

When the manual answer mode is enabled, agents can select **Accept** to interact with the next customer. The conversation panel corresponding to the newly accepted conversation displays when the agent selects this option.

If an agent doesn't accept the assigned interaction in the period specified under answer mode. In that case, the conversation is returned to the queue and the agent status is automatically changed to away to avoid further conversations from being assigned to them.

If Explicit Reject is enabled in the Answer Mode:  

* Agents can Accept (✅) or Reject (❌) each interaction on the conversation tray.  
* **Accept**: Displays conversation panel for that conversation.  

* **Reject**: Removes conversation from agent's queue, and returns it to the queue for reassignment.

    In the case of an agent or supervisor transfer, or queue timeout, the transferred conversation appears with a message indicating the transfer source.

### Auto Answer Mode

If auto answer mode is enabled, the accepted conversations appear at the top or bottom of the conversation tray list, depending on the selected sorting order, and are marked with a **New** indicator. This will be displayed till the agent clicks the conversation and sends the first message.

For more information, refer to [Agent Settings > Answer Mode](../contactcenter/agent-and-supervisors/agent-management/agent-management.md#answer-mode).

If an agent doesn't send the first response to the auto assigned interaction in the period specified under answer mode. In that case, the conversation is returned to the queue and the agent status is automatically changed to away to avoid further conversations from being assigned to them.

## Handling Interactions When Conversation Filters Are Applied

When conversation state filters are applied (for example, ongoing, idle), accepted conversations are displayed on the conversation tray with a **View** option on the conversation. This will be displayed till the agent clicks the conversation and sends the first message.

## Sort Incoming Interactions

New interactions appear at the top of the conversation tray based on their order of acceptance. This can be revised as follows:

1. Select the **↑↓** icon at the top of the conversation tray.

2. Select either **Latest on Top** or **Latest at Bottom**.
