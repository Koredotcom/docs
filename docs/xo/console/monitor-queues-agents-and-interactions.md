# Monitor Queues, Agents, Interactions, and Service Levels

To access the **Monitor** section, you must be an _App Owner, App developer, App Tester,_ or _Supervisor_; or have the _Monitor Console –_ permission set to _Yes_. See [Role Management](../user-management/role-management.md#permissions) for more.

The **Monitor** tab lets you monitor live conversations between agents and customers and displays four views: **Queues**, **Agents**, and **Interactions**.

1. The **Queues** section displays the conversation summary between agents and customers per queue. You only have access to the queues you are part of; and to the agents assigned to the same queues as you.
2. The **Agents** section lets you view agent performance metrics and monitor agent-specific live conversations. Listed agents belong to the same queues you are also assigned to.
3. The **Interactions** section displays all interactions live in Contact Center AI and assigned to agents on the console.

    !!! Note

        Your Monitor access is restricted to the Queues that you are assigned to.
4. A pop-up message appears when the user selects the **Monitor** tab if the Contact Center Permissions are disabled for them.

## Queues

In this section, you can see all the assigned queues. The dashboard shows the number of conversations waiting, the number of engaged conversations, and a summary of agents assigned to the queue along with their current status. The supervisor can see the average wait time, max wait time (an indicator of peak load handling capacity), and drop-off rate.

Selecting the sort icon enables you to sort the columns in ascending/descending order. The default sorting is by Queue Name.

To monitor the agents:

* On the **Monitor** tab, select the **Queue** tab.  
    <img src="../images/queues-tab.png" alt="Queues Tab" title="Queues Tab" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

    !!! Note

        Bot-led interactions don't appear by default, even when bot-led interaction permission is enabled for a role. To view these interactions, supervisors must explicitly select 'Automation' or 'Automation/Agents' from the Participant filter. The default setting remains "Agent" regardless of permission settings to prevent supervisors from being overwhelmed with automation conversations. This keeps automation conversations hidden unless specifically requested while maintaining the flexibility to include them when needed.

    Select from the available options:

    * **Clear** - Clears the selection.  
    * **Save & Apply** - Saves the filter, and it appears when selected.  
    * **Apply** - Applied for one instance and not saved.  

4. Select **Save & Apply**.

5. On the pop-up window, enter a name (up to 20 characters) for the filter and select **Save & Apply**.  
    <img src="../images/save-and-apply.png" alt="Save & Apply" title="Save & Apply" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

    A confirmation message displays and creates the filter.

6. Select Saved Filters. By default, the system shows the following:

    * The Waiting with Agents and Waiting in Queue quick filters are pre-selected. These filters are editable and can be deleted.  
        <img src="../images/interactions-default-filters.png" alt="Default Filters" title="Default Filters" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;"> 
    * You can select up to four quick filters. Quick filters appear along with unsaved filters.
    * If you set a filter as the default but not selected as a quick filter, the system treats it as a quick filter.
    * You can't disable a quick filter while it's applied as a default filter. To disable the quick filter, first remove the default filter.

#### Edit Filter

Steps to edit a filter:

1. Select the **Filters** tab. The Saved Filter name appears.

## Service Levels

This section enables supervisors to  monitor service-level targets based on specific needs.

To monitor service levels, go to Console > Monitor > SERVICE LEVELS.  
<img src="../images/service-levels-dashboard.png" alt="Service Levels Dashboard" title="Service Levels Dashboard" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

The dashboard displays the following information:

**Queues**: Name of the queue for which the system shows the service levels.

**Average Speed to Answer (ASA)**: The average time it takes for agents to answer inbound customer contacts (such as calls or chats) after they enter the queue. It measures the responsiveness of the contact center.

**Response Service Level (SL)**: The percentage of inbound customer contacts answered by agents within a predefined threshold time. It reflects how consistently the contact center meets its response time targets.

**Abandonment Rate**: The percentage of inbound customer contacts (calls, chats, or emails) that customers disconnect or leave before reaching an agent or completing self-service.

**Transfer Rate**: The percentage of customer contacts that agents transfer to another agent, department, or queue after initially answering the interaction.

### Filters

Supervisors can create, edit, copy, mark as default, and delete filters to customize the view of service level metrics.
