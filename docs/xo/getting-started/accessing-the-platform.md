After you sign up for the account, you automatically become the account’s Admin, which allows you to invite other users to the account.
* **Join an existing enterprise account:** If your enterprise is already on Kore.ai, you can become a part of the account in one of the following ways:
    * Your enterprise account’s Apps Admin sends you an invite. If you haven’t already received the invitation email, reach out to them for access.
    * You can sign up using your enterprise email account and you are prompted to either join the enterprise network or create your own personal account.

!!! note "Important Points"

    * The XO Platform offers two types of workspaces/accounts:
        * Standard Workspace: Every new workspace is created as a Standard Workspace by default.
        * Enterprise Workspace: A Standard Workspace can be upgraded to an Enterprise Workspace by a Kore.ai representative.  
    * Workspaces or accounts are interchangeably used.
    * A workspace can have one or more apps.
    * An app within a workspace can be shared with one or more users.
    * A user can be part of one or more apps.
    * A user can be part of one or more workspaces.

## New Account Sign-up

To sign up for a new account on the Kore.ai’s XO Platform, follow these steps:

1. Visit [XO Platform Homepage](https://platform.kore.ai/){:target="_blank"}.
2. On the Sign-up page, enter the email ID in the **Email ID** field.

    !!! note

        If the email address is already registered, the platform prompts you to sign-in  and to enter the password.
  

3. Enter all the other details to create the account.

    !!! note
        The account you create is identified by the email domain. When you invite other users to the account, the email includes this name.

4. On creating an account, a confirmation email is sent to the provided email address, with a verification link and a verification code, to sign in to the new account.

5. You can either click the **Verify Email** button or click/copy paste the verification URL in the browser. Upon verification, your account is created.
6. You can also complete the verification using the 6 digit verification code sent to the registered email address. The code can be entered either on your web browser or the mobile device.

     <img src="../images/accplatform(7).png" alt="image_tooltip" title="image_tooltip" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">
!!! note

    The platform sends reminder emails with the verification link and the code to the users who have not completed the sign up. The emails are sent to the email id provided by you during sign up, at periodic intervals as per the configurations done at the application level (Kore config level), with a new verification link and code upon expiry of the old ones.

    If the verification link or code expires or is invalid, the system displays a message to you, to request a new link and a code to complete the verification process.
 Alternatively, you can sign up to the Kore.ai XO Platform using the Google, Microsoft Office or LinkedIn profiles.

 <img src="../images/accplatform(10).png" alt="image_tooltip" title="image_tooltip" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">

!!! note

    Kore.ai XO Platform uses SAML-based authentication for completing the sign up and sign in flows.

After signing up, users are guided through the onboarding process to create your first app. [Learn more](./guided-onboarding.md).


## Sign in to the Platform

The Kore.ai XO Platform allows you to sign in to your account using your registered email ID and password.

With Single Sign-on (SSO), you can sign in securely (after authentication) by using just one set of credentials. Now, the Kore.ai XO Platform offers an additional layer of security beyond username and password during account sign-in with **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**. Enabling 2FA prompts for a security code verification after you’ve entered your username and password.

## The Platform Landing Page

After you sign in to Kore.ai’s XO Platform, you are directed to the landing page. From this page you can access various offerings as follows:

* **Apps and Related Options** - Lists all the available apps. You can filter the apps by Pinned, Shared, My Apps, or All apps.   
* **Data** – Define Data Tables, Table Views, and manipulate them from your Virtual Assistants and Process Apps.Thus taking care of your data needs, without having to depend on external services.
* **Invite Users** – You can invite members to collaborate on the App creation journey.
* **Help** – Find useful resources and support methods to help you develop your App.
* **Account Switcher** – If you are part of more than one organization, you can switch between accounts.
* **Profile** – Your profile details, set the platform’s language and log out options.
* **New App** – Create a new App or import an existing App.

## Using Workspace

**Workspaces** are a way to organize people productively, while everyone is part of your wider team of Virtual Assistant developers. In the Kore.ai XO Platform, Workspaces are created when setting up your Kore.ai XO Platform account, and if you choose to use SSO.

Team members can join one or multiple Workspaces, or they can create their own. It’s easy to browse Workspaces within the same organization and to switch between them. Here is how it works.

Some of the common scenarios where you can join or sign up to a workspace include the following:

* If you are invited by someone to join their workspace.
* If your enterprise administrator adds you to your enterprise workspace through SSO or API.
* If you use a business email address to sign up, you can join any other workspace that matches your email domain. In such cases, the system only creates a User identity for you and adds you to the selected workspace.
* If you sign up using Single Sign-On (SSO) options like Google or Office 365, the platform will use your email domain as the Workspace name. For example, if your email address is john@doe.com, your workspace will be created as ‘doe.com’. You can always change the Workspace name from the Profile menu.
* If you sign up using the email address verification option, you can define your workspace name during sign up.
* If you are the first user of a workspace, i.e., if you have created the workspace, you will automatically become the Workspace Owner. The email address of the Workspace Owner is used as the workspace’s unique identifier.
* Additional users can be invited to a workspace using the ‘Invite Team’ option or inviting users to a particular assistant. A user can belong to multiple workspaces.

### Join a Workspace

Before setting up your Workspace, you need to sign up to the Kore.ai XO Platform.

If your email domain matches existing Workspaces within the XO Platform, then it means that your organization is already working on projects you may want to join. The Platform lists matching Workspaces and you can **Request Access** to them as soon as you sign up. If you are part of a team, but you are not managing it, then this is the recommended way to proceed.

### Create Your Workspace

If you are managing a team, as part of your organization’s VA development projects, then you may want to create your own Workspace. You can do so by choosing **Create New**, rather than requesting access to an existing Workspace.

<img src="../images/accplatform(3).png" alt="image_tooltip" title="image_tooltip" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">

To create your Workspace, you will need to provide a **Name**, and invite the first members by entering their email addresses. Those who accept your invitation will gain access to this Workspace exclusively.

<img src="../images/accplatform(12).png" alt="image_tooltip" title="image_tooltip" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">

### Invite Members to your Workspace

After the Workspace has been created, Administrators can invite new members using the **Invite** option on the main landing page, in the top navigation menu.

!!! note

    By default, the **Invite Members** option at the Builder level is visible for the admins with the ‘Master Admin’ role. For admins with custom administrator roles, the **Invite** permission should be enabled in the role management.
 
<img src="../images/accplatform(15).png" alt="image_tooltip" title="image_tooltip" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">

### Switch Workspaces

Team members can switch workspaces, using the switcher at the top right, next to the profile area. 

<img src="../images/accplatform(13)new.png" alt="image_tooltip" title="image_tooltip" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">

### Browse Workspaces

Team members can also **Browse Workspaces** to see those that are active within your organization, and to which access can be requested. This option lists Workspaces based on the email domain.

<img src="../images/accplatform(16).png" alt="image_tooltip" title="image_tooltip" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">
