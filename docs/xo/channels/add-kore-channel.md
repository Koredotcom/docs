# Adding the Kore Channel

Adding the Kore channel to your assistant allows end-users to interact with it using the Kore Messaging application available as a web, desktop, or mobile client.

To add the Kore channel, follow the below steps:


1. Select the assistant that you want to add the Kore Messaging channel to.
2. Navigate to **Channels & Flows** > **Channels** > **Digital** > **All** >, click the **Kore** icon. The **Kore Channel** page is displayed.
3. Under the **Enable/Disable Channel** section, select **Enable**
4. Enable **Bot Commands** to be used within Kore Messenger Rooms. Provide a **Command Name,** add **Help** text, give an **Example Command** and enter a **Description**.
5. Click **Save** to enable the channel.

After the channel is enabled and all configurations are verified, you can optionally publish the assistant to make it available for end-users, with the new channel. Learn more about[ Publishing your Virtual Assistant](https://developer.kore.ai/docs/bots/publish/publishing-bot/).
