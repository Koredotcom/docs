# Email

Email is a communication channel through which customers can send inquiries, feedback, or requests to the customer service team for resolution or assistance. It allows for asynchronous communication, maintains a record of interactions, and efficiently handles customer inquiries. By adding the email channel to your AI Agent, end users can interact with it using any standard email client, such as *Microsoft Outlook* or *Yahoo*.

The email channel offers the following functionalities:

* Threaded email structure
* Collapsible email tiles
* Distribution to multiple recipients
* Standard Responses
* Attachments
* Drafts. [Learn more](../console/interacting-with-customers.md#emails).

You can use the Kore.ai Email domain or create your custom Email Domain to configure your email addresses.

To configure the email domains, go to **Flows & Channels** > **Channels** > **Digital** > **All** > **Email**.

## Session Identity and Grouping

### User Identify Source

**Use Reply-To for User Identity**: When enabled, the platform uses the Reply-To address for user and session identification rather than the From address. This is useful when multiple emails share the same From address but have different Reply-To values. This toggle is off by default.


### Session Grouping



**Channel-Based Sessions**: When enabled, the platform creates a new session for each unique "To" email address. Emails sent to the same address continue the existing session, while emails sent to different addresses automatically start new sessions. This keeps issues organized and separate.

**Thread-Based Sessions**: When enabled, the platform creates sessions based on email thread reference headers. Replies within the same thread continue the existing session, while new threads always start fresh sessions. When users or agents add recipients mid-thread, the platform maintains the existing email thread and preserves conversation context. This option is only available when Channel-Based Sessions is enabled.

## DKIM Configuration

DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) supports configuration through a standalone module, allowing users to verify domains before configuring email channels. This approach lets teams prepare the required DNS infrastructure in advance and reuse the verified domain across multiple channels without repeating the verification process.

**Advanced Custom Email Domain**

DKIM verification is mandatory for Advanced email channels. During channel configuration, the platform checks whether the provided domain has a Verified DKIM record. If a verified domain is provided by the user, the platform allows the configuration to continue. If the domain is not verified, the user must complete the DKIM verification before proceeding with the channel setup. 

**Microsoft Exchange**

DKIM signing is optional and controlled by a toggle(disabled by default). When disabled, the platform sends emails through the Microsoft Graph API, letting Microsoft handle outbound email delivery.

When enabled, the platform checks whether the provided domain has a verified DKIM record. If the domain is verified, the platform applies it and allows the channel setup to continue. If the domain is not yet verified, the user must complete DKIM verification before proceeding.

### Step 1: Generate DKIM

Generate and Configure DKIM for this domain by providing your own private key. The Private key must use 1024-bit to 2048-bit RSA encryption, and be PEM-encoded. Refer[ Generating DKIM keys using OpenSSL](generate-dkim.md).


1. Generate RSA key pair (2048-bit recommended).
2. Extract the public key in the proper format.
3. Enter the private key in the DKIM Key field in the Verification screen.
4. Configure the public key in DNS.


### Step 2: Domain Verification



1. Navigate to **Flows & Channels** > **Channels** > **Digital** > **All** > **Email** > **More Options** > **DKIM Configuration**.
.
2. Click **+ Add**.
3. Enter the following details and then click  **Verify Domain**.
    * Select the domain type as either Custom Domain or Microsoft Exchange.
    * **Domain Name**: This is the domain for which you want to subscribe to the mailboxes using the Graph API.
    * **DKIM Private Key**: The DKIM key generated before.
    * **Selector Name**: A DKIM selector is a string that identifies which DKIM public key to use for signature verification. It's part of the DKIM DNS record structure.
        
        **DNS Record Format**: <code>[selector]._domainkey.[[domain.com](http://domain.com)]</code>
        
        **Example**: If your selector is "ses2024" and the domain is "example.com," the DNS record would be: <code>ses2024._domainkey[.example.com](http://.example.com)</code>  

        <img src="../images/new-dkim.png" alt="New DKIM" title="New DKIM" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">




4. The Verification in Progress message is displayed.  
<img src="../images/msexchange2.png" alt="Microsoft Exchange" title="Microsoft Exchange" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

5. Click **Confirm**. You can navigate to the DKIM Configuration page to check the latest status. This might take up to 72 hours. The status can be one of the following:
    * **Pending**: DNS records not yet detected.
    * **Success**: DKIM successfully verified.
    * **Failed**: DNS records are incorrect or missing.
    * **Temporary Failure**: DNS issues, will retry automatically.

## Kore.ai Email Domain

Contact centers need to enable forwarding to the email address configured in the Contact Center AI system. This ensures that any email received by the contact center from its end customer is automatically forwarded to the Kore domain. The Kore domain is linked to the experience flow, allowing seamless integration and management of customer inquiries.

With the capabilities of the experience flow, we can efficiently route incoming emails to appropriate agents, analyze customer intents, execute automation, and more. This streamlined process ensures that each customer query is addressed promptly and accurately.

Any reply email managed by either the Human Agent or the AI Agent is directly sent to the end customer. To maintain transparency and accountability, the customer contact center domain is included in the BCC (Blind Carbon Copy) field and the Reply-to field. This configuration ensures that communication remains open and accessible to all relevant parties.

Whenever the customer responds to the email thread, it is directed back to the customer contact center domain. From there, it is seamlessly forwarded to the Kore domain, ensuring a continuous and efficient communication loop.

## Custom Email Domain

Custom email domains add a professional look to your email communications, reinforcing your brand identity with every email you send or receive. Customers perceive custom emails as established, reliable, and legitimate compared to generic email addresses. For example, You can create [help@yourbusiness.com](mailto:help@yourbusiness.com), a branded email account that uses your organization's domain name instead of a domain provided platform. You can add up to three email accounts (sales@, support@, info@, etc.) in each custom domain for better organization and delegation. By granting access to your email accounts within the domain, you can track the activity of the configured accounts, respond to incoming emails, and send outbound emails. Email filters are less likely to flag emails from custom domains as spam, ensuring better deliverability rates.

Currently, we support two types of custom domains: Standard and Advanced. The Standard has a limitation of 5 domains and 5 emails per domain, whereas the Advanced supports 50 domains and 50 emails per domain.

### Standard Custom Domain

#### Step 3: Email Blocklist

Email blocklisting allows admins to specify a list of blocklisted email addresses during email address creation preventing blocking interactions originating from blocklisted email addresses, automations, and subsequent agent transfers are prevented, reducing unnecessary processing, and ensuring that resources are allocated to valid interactions.

**Blocklist Verification**

Upon receiving a new interaction, the system checks the incoming email address against the blocklist associated with the receiving email address.

* If a match is found between the incoming email address and the blocklist, any pre-configured automations linked to the receiving email address will be disabled for that specific interaction. Automated agent transfers triggered by the interaction will be prevented, ensuring that blocklisted emails do not initiate further actions within the system.
* If no match is found, the system will continue with the usual automation processes and agent transfer rules, handling the  interaction normally.

**Configure Email Blocklist**

Steps to Configure Email Blocklist:

1. Click the **Email Blocklist** tab and turn on the **Enable Email Blocklist** toggle.  
    <img src="../images/email-blocklist-tab.png" alt="Email Blocklist Tab" title="Email Blocklist Tab" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

### Advanced Custom Domain

AI for Service now enhances custom domains with advanced capabilities, including email forwarding, domain setup, DKIM, and Flow mapping to improve scalability and brand alignment in enterprise email automation.

Key enhancements:


* Email Forwarding: Centralize email processing by forwarding emails from enterprise domains to a single Kore.ai mailbox.
* Advanced Custom Domain Setup: This new option, in addition to the existing Standard setup, supports up to 50 custom domains and 50 email addresses per domain.
* DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) Support: Secure email authentication is now provided for each advanced custom email domain.
* Flow Mapping by Email ID: Route incoming emails accurately by linking custom domain email addresses to specific Flows.





#### Complete Configuration

Complete the configuration steps to set up an advanced custom domain and add an email ID to it.
Ensure that the DKIM verification is successful.



1. Navigate to **Flows & Channels** > **Channels** > **Digital** > **All** > **Email.**
2. Click **+ New Email ID** for the Advanced domain to add an email to it.
3. Enter the **Display Name**, add the **Email ID** from which emails have to be forwarded or sent, and select the **Usage**.
4. Click **Save**. The configuration saved message is displayed.




## Microsoft Exchange


The platform supports configuring email IDs for sending and receiving emails, either manually or via Microsoft 365 Groups. The email IDs marked as Inbound Only or Inbound & Outbound can be attached to flows, while Outbound Only are available for agents to send outbound emails.

**Add a Microsoft 365 Group**: Adding a Microsoft 365 Group automatically retrieves and configures all associated email IDs.

**Add Email IDs Manually**: Email IDs can be added manually with a defined usage (default: Outbound). Manually added IDs must be unique and must not belong to an existing 365 Group, as the platform will reject duplicates.
If a manually added email ID is later found in a synced group, the group configuration takes precedence, and the email ID is automatically removed from the manual list to prevent duplication.
