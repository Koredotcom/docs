# Email

Email is a communication channel through which customers can send inquiries, feedback, or requests to the customer service team for resolution or assistance. It allows for asynchronous communication, maintains a record of interactions, and efficiently handles customer inquiries. By adding the email channel to your AI Agent, end users can interact with it using any standard email client, such as *Microsoft Outlook* or *Yahoo*.

The email channel offers the following functionalities:

* Threaded email structure
* Collapsible email tiles
* Distribution to multiple recipients
* Standard Responses
* Attachments
* Drafts. [Learn more](../console/interacting-with-customers.md#emails).

You can use the Kore.ai Email domain or create your custom Email Domain to configure your email addresses.

To configure the email domains, go to **Flows & Channels** > **Channels** > **Digital** > **All** > **Email**.

## Session Creation Settings


**Channel-Based Sessions**: When enabled, the platform creates a new session for each unique "To" email address. Emails sent to the same address continue the existing session, while emails sent to different addresses automatically start new sessions. This keeps issues organized and separate.

**Thread-Based Sessions**: When enabled, the platform creates sessions based on email thread reference headers. Replies within the same thread continue the existing session, while new threads always start fresh sessions. When users or agents add recipients mid-thread, the platform maintains the existing email thread and preserves conversation context. This option is only available when Channel-Based Sessions is enabled.

## Kore.ai Email Domain

Contact centers need to enable forwarding to the email address configured in the Contact Center AI system. This ensures that any email received by the contact center from its end customer is automatically forwarded to the Kore domain. The Kore domain is linked to the experience flow, allowing seamless integration and management of customer inquiries.

With the capabilities of the experience flow, we can efficiently route incoming emails to appropriate agents, analyze customer intents, execute automation, and more. This streamlined process ensures that each customer query is addressed promptly and accurately.

Any reply email managed by either the Human Agent or the AI Agent is directly sent to the end customer. To maintain transparency and accountability, the customer contact center domain is included in the BCC (Blind Carbon Copy) field and the Reply-to field. This configuration ensures that communication remains open and accessible to all relevant parties.

Whenever the customer responds to the email thread, it is directed back to the customer contact center domain. From there, it is seamlessly forwarded to the Kore domain, ensuring a continuous and efficient communication loop.

## Custom Email Domain

Custom email domains add a professional look to your email communications, reinforcing your brand identity with every email you send or receive. Customers perceive custom emails as established, reliable, and legitimate compared to generic email addresses. For example, You can create [help@yourbusiness.com](mailto:help@yourbusiness.com), a branded email account that uses your organization's domain name instead of a domain provided platform. You can add up to three email accounts (sales@, support@, info@, etc.) in each custom domain for better organization and delegation. By granting access to your email accounts within the domain, you can track the activity of the configured accounts, respond to incoming emails, and send outbound emails. Email filters are less likely to flag emails from custom domains as spam, ensuring better deliverability rates.

Currently, we support two types of custom domains: Standard and Advanced. The Standard has a limitation of 5 domains and 5 emails per domain, whereas the Advanced supports 50 domains and 50 emails per domain.

### Standard Custom Domain

#### Step 3: Email Blocklist

Email blocklisting allows admins to specify a list of blocklisted email addresses during email address creation preventing blocking interactions originating from blocklisted email addresses, automations, and subsequent agent transfers are prevented, reducing unnecessary processing, and ensuring that resources are allocated to valid interactions.

**Blocklist Verification**

Upon receiving a new interaction, the system checks the incoming email address against the blocklist associated with the receiving email address.

* If a match is found between the incoming email address and the blocklist, any pre-configured automations linked to the receiving email address will be disabled for that specific interaction. Automated agent transfers triggered by the interaction will be prevented, ensuring that blocklisted emails do not initiate further actions within the system.
* If no match is found, the system will continue with the usual automation processes and agent transfer rules, handling the  interaction normally.

**Configure Email Blocklist**

Steps to Configure Email Blocklist:

1. Click the **Email Blocklist** tab and turn on the **Enable Email Blocklist** toggle.  
    <img src="../images/email-blocklist-tab.png" alt="Email Blocklist Tab" title="Email Blocklist Tab" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">
